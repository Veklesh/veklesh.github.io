<p>Episode 65.</p>

<p>“Hu, hah, hah, hah...”</p>

<p>The cold air flowing from the surface of the lake is sucked into his lungs, transformed into hot breath, and exhaled. In contrast to his violently spinning legs, his upper body with the axe and spear in his hand makes not the slightest movement. Despite his pulsating heart and racing nerves, Walm's thoughts were extremely calm.</p>

<p>The tip of his spear points toward the wall that sits at the mouth of the attack. These are the Craist soldiers who were ordered to cover the retreating siege troops from Cape Laga. All of them looked on the verge of panic, but they formed several lines of flanks as they had been trained to do, without breaking their positions. It would be a shame to lose them, but even if they were lost, they could be replaced. Therefore, they are the highest grade of disposable.</p>

<p>Something glowed in front of my eyes. A dot the size of a grain of rice swelled up in a flash. Realizing that he could not avoid it, Walm lowered his forehead as if bowing. A dull pain and shock ran through his helmet, as if he had been punched. The debris bounced off the oval sheet metal and ricocheted in a strange direction.</p>

<p>“Oh, it's a projectile!”</p>

<p>A friend of mine falls over like a puppet with broken strings at the edge of my field of vision. Screams and crushing sounds made by the projectiles were everywhere. No other species is as adept at throwing projectiles as the human species. It is effective even against its own kind. However, the stones were too small to stop a simultaneous assault by a species of light infantry. The firepower of the magic soldiers they rely on to stop them must have been exhausted by now. However, the lack of firepower is mutual.</p>

<p>Otherwise, Walm would not have chosen to rush forward without a magical membrane, just as he did when he was a single soldier. He rubs shoulders with his temporary companion, his comrades, and they make each other hear the sound of their breathing, even if they don't like it. Their breastplates sway with each kick to the ground, making a noisy metallic sound.</p>

<p>The distance between us is shrinking. The reddish-black tip of the spear glistens, ready to strike the lightly-armed infantryman in the face. Without magical powers, the means of replying were limited. Walm expressed his gratitude in primitive language. The soldiers in the line of battle, not as indicated by anyone else, also spoke the same words.</p>

<p>“Ooooooh, ooooh, ooooh!”</p>

<p>The monkey shouts indicated intimidation, control, and a desire to kill. Spears twined like threads, fighting each other on behalf of each other's will. At the boundary of the thorns, solid armor is shattered, and sharp blades rip through bodies in a haphazard manner. Those who fall down are trampled and crushed to death regardless of friend or foe. In the front rows, the love of beautiful neighbors was lacking.</p>

<p>Walm, whose spear tip was aimed at the face, was repelled by a branch blade and stabbed with the same momentum of his rush. The tip of the spear pierced through a gap in the armor to the lower abdomen, burying itself close to the root. His muscles contracted and his pelvis clamped down on the blade. He kicks the Craist soldier in the chest, who shivers in death as he pulls the hilt with both hands.</p>

<p>“Ugh, ugh, gee--”</p>

<p>The enemy soldier gasped in spectacular pain as the axe spear was twisted and forcibly pulled out. The Demon Mask trembled as it sipped the wine of blood and demons. Without a glance, Walm set out to eliminate the next in line. After a scuffle, he seizes the head, and when the front disappears, he extends his axe and spear to the left and right.</p>

<p>There was no need for a killing blow. The social gathering place of those who seek to enforce the will of the community, the nation, through violence is filled with all kinds of hostility and harmful intent. If a branch blade disrupts an enemy soldier's posture for a moment, no one will be fool enough to let it go. If they fall down, they will be crushed from above. And so they turned into a brand-new stain on the soles of their shoes.</p>

<p>"You guys, widen the hole!　Body or weapon, let them twist into the flanks."</p>

<p>"They're not very good at this. Show them how to use their spears."</p>

<p>Walm, who had been reverted to a light infantryman as his magic ran out, simply continued to swing his weapon. Gentlemanly shouts, the percussion of swords and spears, screams and shouts of rage passed in and out of his ears like background music. He killed the enemy in front of him without thinking. Why attack? Because the enemy has pulled back. Why stop, because the enemy stopped.</p>

<p>"What the hell is this guy?　Damn it, if he's coming, come on!!!!"</p>

<p>In response to the invitation, the light infantryman swung his axe-spear down from the topmost position. The blow, which had no magic power in its flesh or axe-spear, was caught by the raised sword. If they could not be broken with a single blow, they would only be met with a second blow. Against Walm, the enemy soldier jumped in with a sword that had spilled its blade. Neither swordsmanship nor posture was good enough. However, the Craist soldier in front of him had a self-sacrificing will to fight.</p>

<p>"Gah!</p>

<p>Walm chose neither a slash nor a stab. He twisted himself around and delivered a stone thrust from the side, which was on his side. The stone thrust came at him from a blind spot and struck him hard in the side of the head. The eyes that had been staring at the lightly-armed infantryman turned around and looked in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>The exposed rear guard blocked Walm's path with their spears. Unlike the men in the front ranks, the spear thrusts were cowardly. After a one-sided battle, the spear tip was brought out to his chest.</p>

<p>"Uh, ah!</p>

<p>There was no response to be desired. The enemy soldier, his feet caught in the sludge, fell on his buttocks, slightly extending his time of death. They did not even understand what had happened. He swung his axe spear down as before.</p>

<p>“Wait!”</p>

<p>One less voice came from the battlefield. A sticky thread pulled from the axe head that had dug into his helmet. There was still work to be done. The more he hammered away, the less he would have to think about.</p>

<p>Nuttan, nuttan, the axe-spear ticked in a watery rhythm. The tip of the spear, which pierced the enemy soldier's flank, sank into the cheese like chopsticks into cheese. When it strikes the skull, it cracks and pops like a watermelon, spilling its contents. When the spear tip hits the bone, it feels strange. It is similar to the discomfort of an eggshell mixed with a soft fried egg.</p>

<p>The world that was being conveyed through the five senses was strange in any way. I felt as if I were in a state of inebriation. I was floating. It was as if my thoughts were following the natural movement of my body. I was just running my eyes in search of a new move. The face of the person I had just killed suddenly came to mind. His words were not uttered until the end, but Walm understood. He understood.</p>

<p>What kind of man was the man who begged for his life? He was probably not more than twenty years old. His body was not well-fleshed, and he had a poor diet. He was probably a peasant who had jumped into the army in search of food.</p>

<p>Sympathy for the enemy kills you. In order to maintain his mental balance, Walm has unconsciously detached a part of himself in the form of military rationality, and has adapted by making a kind of switch. That switching in the realm of conscience was ambiguous.</p>

<p>“Huh, ugh--don't think, don't think.”</p>

<p>A hot lump rose in my throat. I told myself, as if by implication, but to no avail. A scene inexplicably wells up. The comrades-in-arms who had shared the hardships and joys of war, the Kingsguard who had carried on, the countrymen who had wanted to return home, they were gone. They were all dead. Around Walm, people often died. He was really killing all the time.</p>

<p>Memories flood in when I put the lid on it. The mind moves. It is useless to play the role of a mindless person. There will always be discrepancies. What's ingrained in you won't go away so easily.</p>

<p>“Huh, ah, ah, ah, ah--”</p>

<p>The mental equilibrium goes haywire. Move your body to stay sane, fulfill your responsibilities. As you do so, you have less and less time to think. Walm steps forward to seek salvation. The balance that was temporarily maintained by fighting was soon broken. The number of enemy soldiers who could serve as his lord was dwindling. In one corner of his mind, he wishes for the battle to end, while in the other corner, he is contradictorily wishing that they would not disappear yet.</p>

<p>A sense of frayed moral fiber, a sense that what little goodness remained in me was crumbling. The more room I have, the more foolishly my thoughts spin. In the end, the enemy soldiers have disappeared from Cape Raga. Only corpses and prisoners of war remain. The axe and spear are covered in vermilion, like a thick coat of makeup. Armor was also stained with blood. The only exception was the Demon Mask, which had been soaked in blood.</p>

<p>“Are you satisfied?”</p>

<p>I asked the Demon Mask I had removed. It shuddered and fell silent once, as if it was proud of itself. The mask, filled with dryness, is tucked into his waist pouch. Walm's expression remained frozen like a mask, even though his true face was exposed to the open air. He could not even change his facial expression.</p>

<p>A fire flickers on the discarded supplies. Walm wanders up to it like a winged insect lured by the light. With trembling hands, he pulls out a cigarette. It took him a long time to light the cigarette, and he had trouble keeping it lit. After much effort, he sucked the cigarette into his mouth with dry lips and inhaled slowly. The white smoke sinks into his lungs. The rising purple smoke wandered and fizzled out.</p>

<p>“Haha ...... tastes bad, huh?”</p>

<p>I laughed with a straight face, even though it wasn't funny. Only bitterness spreads to the roots of my tongue. No matter how many times I try, the bitterness never fades. This would be the same with alcohol. The wine of victory is no better than sludge water now. Even though he knew this, Walm could not help but inhale.</p>

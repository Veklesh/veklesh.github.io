        <p>Episode 6 Brother and Brother</p>

        <p>The house where he spent most of his second life is no longer in its original state. The only thing that
            remains is a large beam that has been burned and decayed, and the stone that served as the foundation for
            the support pillars. The soles of his shoes are covered with charred building materials, remnants of the
            house. I am not surprised. It was Walm himself, of all people, who burned down his hometown, and he had
            already prepared for this.</p>

        <p>The only thing that troubled Walm at the moment was a conversation with his eldest son, Hayes. They have
            moved from the tombstone and are sitting opposite each other on an old stone slab. It has been more than two
            years since he began his military service. There are so many things I want to tell him, so many things I
            want to ask him. But I am at a loss for words, as if there is sludge stuck in my throat. Silence reigns in
            the village. Walm had been through a lot of rough patches in his life, but to lose his voice at the reunion
            of his brothers was a shameful thing to do. His lips dry up. Walm regulated his breathing, swallowed his
            spit, and finally made up his mind, but he was a little too late.</p>

        <p>Hey, Walm,“ he said, ”remember that? Remember when you ate too many tubers that Ruud dug up and got a stomach
            ache?</p>

        <p>While going about his daily life as usual, Hayes spoke to him as if he had just recalled an old story. I
            don't need to search his head. The event is etched in Walm's memory. And how could he forget his second
            brother's name?</p>

        <p>I remember that," he says. Rude had eaten too much, but he was hiding and eating the tuberous root raw.</p>

        <p>Playing in the woods was often directly related to the search for food. The way they dig up the ground, not
            missing even the slightest ivy, is probably as good as a hound dog. The actuality is, even though they call
            themselves hounds, the brothers were once very young and were probably only puppies at best.</p>

        <p>"Oh, yes. He was moaning with a terrible look on his face, wasn't he? His pathetic voice echoed through the
            forest, and even the adults came to check on him.</p>

        <p>The cost of outwitting your siblings is high. Rude was forced to not only moan and groan, but also to let out
            a variety of other noises in the grass, reminiscent of the beast he had been handcuffed to. Walm, appalled
            by his second brother's disgusting behavior, was urged by the adults who had rushed to the scene to turn his
            search for food into a search for medicinal herbs to relieve his stomachache. It was a terrible cleanup.
            Walm's mouth turned up at the corners, caught by his brother. He then spoke of a memory that came to mind.
        </p>

        <p>Speaking of ...... Ruud, he was also the one who got the short end of the stick when he and the kids from the
            neighboring village beat up the imps.</p>

        <p>The conversation proceeded without a hitch, as if the stalemate of just a few minutes before had been a lie.
        </p>

        <p>I'm pretty sure it was Hugo's guys. The goblin threw a shit that hit Ruud right in the face, and he was
            furious.</p>

        <p>"Yeah, and when I went after him, he slipped on the shit and was covered in it.</p>

        <p>I don't know what he ate that made him smell so bad."</p>

        <p>The brothers' interaction continues, starting with their childhood memories. Most of their stories are silly
            old tales. In the battlefield, there was no time to dwell on the past, and now that the war is over, there
            is no one to share memories with, and the opportunity to do so should have been lost forever. But now I am
            able to laugh from the bottom of my heart. After an hour or two of frequent conversation, the conversation
            was cut short again. It is not that there is nothing to talk about. It was because they understood what they
            had to say to each other. Hayes opened the conversation again.</p>

        <p>Walm,“ he said, ”the village has been lonely since you and Hugo's men went into the army. Even though it was
            customary for the second son or younger to become a soldier, there wasn't a day that went by that I didn't
            regret sending them off. I should have gone. I really feel that way."</p>

        <p>I can assure you. It was not a labor of love or superficial words. The atmosphere that Hayes has is
            distinctly different from that of the older brother in his memories. Walm remembers the air he wore, the
            expression on his face, and the look in his eyes. It was something unique to him, having experienced the
            horrific battlefield as a soldier. The wounds on his body, which had grown one size larger, must have been
            made by repeated battles.</p>

        <p>The same must have been true for Walm from Hayes' point of view. They both knew what had happened to each
            other, which is why they had avoided saying what had happened to their village and family until this point.
            They are like each other as soldiers and as brothers. He opened his heavily closed mouth and began to tell
            his story.</p>

        <p>"At ...... time, Highserk was on a winning streak. The Hyselk had won a victory at Sarajevo Fortress against
            the Four Nations Alliance, and the imperial capital was in a victorious mood. However, I, a peasant, was out
            of the loop. Old people who had served in the military could only predict the war situation using the ground
            as a piece of paper. I couldn't possibly see what was going on out here in the countryside, though."</p>

        <p>Hayes's voice lowers to a whisper.</p>

        <p>That day. Yes, that day. I was carrying the harvested crops to town with the young men of the village when we
            were attacked by a pack of demons. The whole country must have been in turmoil at the time. As far as the
            village was concerned, we didn't get much information beforehand."</p>

        <p>For many Highserk people, that day represents an irreversible turning point for their country, their
            hometown, and their families. What it meant was a Great Outbreak.</p>

        <p>We had axes and machetes for self-defense. But even so, in the face of such a stormy sea monster, they were
            little more than twigs stroking a mighty river. Still, I resisted to the death. When I came to, the place
            was quiet. I couldn't tell whose blood it was or if it was mine. There was a lude guy lying in the shadow of
            a tree. He had some scratches, but he looked like he was sleeping. I shook him. Over and over again. I told
            him to get up. He didn't wake up no matter how long it took. I must have hit him wrong. He died instantly."
        </p>

        <p>Walm, faced with the death of his brother, whom he could not take care of, chewed on each word, uttered
            nothing, and simply listened.</p>

        <p>I hid the body and ran to the village. As far as I was concerned, I couldn't mourn him, and I felt guilty
            about it. Still, I was going to warn people of the danger and protect the village. I was relieved when I saw
            a shadow. I thought I had arrived ...... in time, but in fact it was too late. The demons that swept in
            during the Great Outbreak had turned the village into a demon territory. There were many of them moving, but
            they weren't human anymore. My uncle, my father, my mother, you know."</p>

        <p>The memory would come back to him, even if he didn't want it to. Hayes choked on his words. Walm was about to
            open his mouth, but stopped himself. His brother had not stopped talking.</p>

        <p>He said, "I ran without knowing what was right or wrong. At the time, I didn't want to die. That was all I
            wanted. The strangers we met along the way didn't understand what was going on. All they knew was that the
            direction of the capital was dangerous. We continued our escape, taking casualties and falling off the
            ranks. We didn't even have time to count how many demons we killed.</p>

        <p>Walm was a defeated soldier at Dandurg Castle, and the scenes he witnessed during his rout to his homeland
            came to mind one after another. The preconstructed defense line was overtaken by the Flame Emperor Dragon,
            and the roads and chain of command were cut off one after another. It was easy to read that organized
            resistance was being lost as the battle traces were found in various places.</p>

        <p>When the path of the demons was blocked and the motley group came to a halt, I thought that the battle was
            finally over and I was prepared to be annihilated. The mother of a young child begged me to kill her rather
            than be eaten by the demons. I was about to do something about it. After all, I didn't swing my sword. No,
            no. I couldn't. Partly because I wasn't ready, I suppose, but also because, unbelievably, help was on the
            way. I just stood there, watching the demons being swept away, unable to rejoice. Then I joined the army,
            and I've been killing demons for a year and a half. I see that now. No, I guess what I went through is still
            lukewarm. Walm, I never regretted sending you off to war. Sorry, really."</p>

        <p>Hayes says, as if in penitence. It was too much to take in all at once, too many emotions to sort them all
            out. Still, Walm was the first to express his true feelings.</p>

        <p>'It's probably done,' he said. There were the conventions of military service and the poverty of the house.
            Besides, in the end, someone had to go in their place. Even if I could go back in time, I wouldn't want to
            impose that role on anyone else. Besides, I've done a lot of dirty and terrible things on the battlefield.
            I'm not the kind of person you can criticize."</p>

        <p>Walm clapped his brother on the shoulder and smiled wickedly.</p>

        <p>I don't know which one of us is the older brother. I don't know which one of us is the older brother.</p>

        <p>I'll take that as a compliment. By the way, are you in the Eastern Army?</p>

        <p>When I asked him about the army in which he and his brother would have fought a year and a half after the
            fall of the capital, Hayes's color changed quickly.</p>

        <p>He replied, “Not ...... the same.”</p>

        <p>Walm, in reply to his denial, lists the remaining armies.</p>

        <p>Then the South."</p>

        <p>The expression on his brother's face suggested that it was neither the Eastern nor Southern Directions Army.
            Hayes spoke to calm Walm's confusion.</p>

        <p>Walm, listen to me very carefully. The unit that saved us was not Highserk.</p>

        <p>Hayes, you can't be serious.</p>

        <p>It was Liberitoa."</p>

        <p>The brothers' gazes crossed momentarily. The air, which had been so warm, had turned cold and was transformed
            as if it were clinging to their entire bodies.</p>

<p>Episode 15The Military Port City of Ancusio</p>

<p>The shining sunlight mixes with the shimmering surface of the lake to create a luminous glow. In contrast to the shimmering water, an imposing structure stood intimidatingly tall. It was a lakeside rampart that curved gently from the land to the water. It cut a semicircle through the lake and covered the built-up harbor.</p>

<p>"No wonder Highserk's poor navy can't take it down. It's not the same thing."</p>

<p>Walm, who was shown its majesty through the smoky porthole, was beyond jealous and was simply dumbfounded. It is not only a military port. It was built to defend the harbor from enemy ships and aquatic monsters, but it also serves as a breakwater to protect the harbor from waves. In addition, two defending vessels stand guard in the distance, establishing a patrol line to prevent any attempts to raid the bay. Anxio, the central city of the Celta Peninsula, is not a strategic point that relies heavily on its natural advantages.</p>

<p>The warship that Walm had boarded joins the line of numerous ships, ranging from military to merchant vessels. The anchor dropped into the water with a rumbling sound, and with a shout, the ropes for berthing the ship were hung to the pier.</p>

<p>The Highserk soldiers are spewed out from the gangplanks onto the pier without interruption. The repetitive motion is like an industrial product being shipped. Even though they are firmly lined up in a row, a company of soldiers takes up a lot of space. They cannot occupy the pier forever.</p>

<p>Friug, the company commander, gives detailed instructions to his men and is extremely busy guiding the group. Walm, on the other hand, is busy with his comrades-in-arms and is only passing the time in a corner where he does not interfere with the landing operations. Fortunately, the rough ropes that come and go during the landing operations, the materials being hoisted up, and the rarities of the landings all help to alleviate the boredom.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much for waiting.”</p>

<p>The person I'm looking forward to meeting comes without warning. It was a very familiar voice. Walm turns around and welcomes him with a toothy grin.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's been a long time. Have you lost some weight?"</p>

<p>Although he is not much older than Walm, his receding head and small belly, which asserts its presence, give him the appearance of a weary merchant. In addition to his natural disposition, the days he spent as a lackey for the command staff must have fostered a somewhat reassuring demeanor.</p>

<p>"No, no, as you can see, I'm doing my best to maintain the status quo. After all, unlike the Empire, we had no shortage of marine products."</p>

<p>He proudly thrusts out his belly like a small drum. The fisheries that have settled in his abdomen must be very happy. Walm firmly took the hand offered by Moritz.</p>

<p>“Deborah and Yogim have also offered to guide us, but I'll be the one to do it, if I may be so bold.”</p>

<p>"Are they safe too? What now?"</p>

<p>I ask him about the recent situation of the family members who were under his command in the defense of Dandurg.</p>

<p>"Deborah is in charge of teaching the new recruits, and Yogim and Moyes are assisting her. Rolling recruits into the earth and kicking their asses in the drill hall is her current hobby, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"You can imagine. I'm afraid I'm going to accidentally crush your body with my bare hands."</p>

<p>She says she touches them like she's petting a kitten.</p>

<p>That's nice.</p>

<p>It was amusing to hear that the bloodthirsty new recruit was no different than an adorable kitten to Deborah. They checked each other's well being, and Moritz extended his hand to urge her on.</p>

<p>“Walk with me and show me the way.”</p>

<p>I followed his well-fleshed back as he padded along. The harbor is unusual, but we can't explore it closely. Sailors and soldiers passing by did not have the time to go out of their way to give way to two people. Although the outpost that also serves as the castle gate is large enough for even a dragon species to dive under, it remains a bottleneck in traffic. In addition to the physical confines, the stares of others tickled Walm's skin. The Highserk soldiers are probably not as unusual as the rare beasts. Their gazes are not only of a friendly color.</p>

<p>“It's a pity, but there are a certain number of people in Myard who don't want Highserk to get a big look at them.”</p>

<p>Moritz opens his mouth as we make our way through the crowd and along the lakeside ramparts.</p>

<p>"I think it's just that the slaves have changed from Ferius to Highserk. Considering the number of Highserk soldiers stationed in Celta, their caution is not something to be laughed off."</p>

<p>There is a saying, "Lend an eave and you will get the main house. In light of Highserk's past behavior, their fears are not entirely out of line.</p>

<p>“Even though we are friends now, it is not a pleasant feeling to see our former enemies strolling through the garden.”</p>

<p>"It is also Myard who has allowed his soldiers to be stationed in Celta because of the lack of troops and the old Highserk soldiers' ties. You know the need. Besides, now Highserk has learned to be considerate."</p>

<p>“And what do you mean?”</p>

<p>"It is Brigadier Justus who is in charge of the coordination and buffering between the two countries, especially between the armies. He now belongs to Myard. I heard that he was approached by the former regional army to help rebuild the Highserk empire, but he said that he was determined not to go down a path of right and left. Without him, the two countries would not have come together so smoothly. He has done so much for us."</p>

<p>In Dandurg, it was the name of a general who united the soldiers and people and shared their suffering. On the one hand, he was the commander in charge of the isolated old castle, and on the other hand, he was the frontline commander. Although they did not communicate directly, his work was indispensable to the defense of the temporary walls. At the same time, he is the man who dangled the bait of regular soldiers to Walm, who craved for regular soldiers, and made him a wartime battalion commander.</p>

<p>"Are you still a brigade commander?　In Myard?"</p>

<p>"Myard introduced reforms in military organization in his reestablishment. The same format as Highserk and Liberitoa. The Grand Duke now believes that a relationship of servitude and imbalance would be the second coming of Felius. A relationship of equality, that's what is strongly required in Celta today."</p>

<p>“...... has changed.”</p>

<p>As Walm expressed his feelings, he looked at the warehouse district built along the lake wall, where soldiers from both countries were engaged in a discussion, gesticulating in front of temporarily placed materials. It was unclear whether they were carrying materials in and out or prearranging the work process. There was no sophistication in their appearance. Still, the appearance of trial and error for the best appears favorable.</p>

<p>"Now that Ferius has collapsed, it cannot help but change, for better or worse. That's not just Highserk, but all the surrounding countries."</p>

<p>Just as Highserk stood on the brink of destruction, Myard was also on the brink of destruction. To add to that, there is also an exiled antagonist named Ferius. Seeing how people from a ruined nation were treated even if they survived was enough to change a person and a nation.</p>

<p>Walm, who had passed through the warehouse district near the port while chatting with others, entered the city of Ancushio, his final destination. The city, which has flourished since the Kanoan era, is indeed a well-organized city.</p>

<p>“It's a well-planned city.”</p>

<p>"At that time, the Kingdom of Canoa had a lot of spare capacity and worked hard to build the city. It's regrettable, but it's different from the empire with a history full of joints, from the foundation of urban design."</p>

<p>Envy and sarcasm mixed in the tone of his voice. Varigend, the imperial capital of the mother country, has been expanding and adding to its size as the empire has grown. Defensibility was the most important factor, and the construction of plots and cities was considered secondary. The result was a neglect of convenience and the space for immigration.</p>

<p>The irony is that the city now functions more rationally than it did when it was burned down and is in the process of being rebuilt.</p>

<p>If there is one concern, it is that the city is not as well protected as a military port. It can even be said to be vulnerable. In Walm's eyes, however, this is the result of deliberately focusing resources on two areas. The port, the gateway to the city by water, is blocked by a strong navy and walls on the lake. The land route, on the other hand, is a series of mountain passes at the base of the peninsula. Several of the roads are cliffy, and one must take a road called a kirikiri, which is flanked on both sides by a rock face. The unique terrain was ideal for handling a large army with a small number of men.</p>

<p>Unlike the Kingdom of Craist, which had a buffer zone called Ferius, distance, and space to reduce the Great Outbreak, Celta repelled the Great Outbreak single-handedly. What would have happened if materials and personnel had been allocated to defending the city half-heartedly? What would have happened if the city had been half-heartedly defended with materials and manpower?</p>

<p>People who had lost their land and their livelihoods were just sitting around, apathetically begging for food, and soldiers who had lost their limbs. These were the gruesome scenes of occupied and war-torn areas that Walm knew. In front of us, we see citizens busily coming and going, and merchants calling out to their customers. Fresh fish lined the storefronts, and goods brought in were lined up in rows. It is indeed a wholesome scene. Even the Highserk soldiers who pass by do not act out of order or behave in an unmannerly manner. Infants as tall as their chests are running past, laughing and waving sticks. There is no blood, no guts, no smell of decay. It's just a playful game.</p>

<p>“...... this is peace, peace?”</p>

<p>The words in my mouth are just heavy. A feeling I had long since forgotten since falling into this world. The once ordinary life that I longed for is now extraordinary.</p>

<p>“That way is the castle of the Grand Duke of Myard.”</p>

<p>The words invite me to look up, and the castle, the symbol of the city, spreads out in my field of vision. It was a plain castle separated by a wall. There was no moat, but horseshoe-shaped towers lined up at equal intervals.</p>

<p>“I thought I was wrong in assuming that the castle was not well defended.”</p>

<p>"It's a key point in the peninsula's governance. The city cannot be enclosed, but the main building, which is the last defense, must be of a reasonable size.</p>

<p>A strong castle gives security to one's own people and makes one's opponents hesitant. Materialism is not to be scoffed at.</p>

<p>“This way.”</p>

<p>We followed the directions and entered the castle through one of the gates. Passing through several corridors and past a garden, Moritz's feet stop. From the outside, he guessed that it was a church building that also served as a medical clinic. The fact that the only people coming in and out of the building were wounded or sick was also a confirmation of this. Their faces were strangely not distorted with pessimism. Perhaps the treatment inside gives them hope and vitality.</p>

<p>“Like me, she must have waited two years for this moment.”</p>

<p>When he said that, Walm was not so perceptive that he did not know what he was referring to. Two years. It was a very bad story for Walm, who had spent half of that time drowning in alcohol, despite the fact that she had continued to heal people as usual.</p>

<p>She is thirsty and her legs are heavy as lead. She is ashamed to admit that she is much more adept at combat. What's there to be afraid of? Walm thought to himself as he stepped onto the property. The soles of his shoes pound on the cobblestones. He presses his hand against the door to free it. The heavy oak door is studded with iron plates, adding to its weight. With a great deal of force, the door is finally opened.</p>

<p>The interior of the exposed room is quite simple, with a design that gives no sense of the worship that accompanies church buildings. Compared to the other treatment centers I have seen so far, the word “simple” fits it well. The only decoration is the stained glass inlaid into the walls. The glass, tinted with dyes, shines brightly.</p>

<p>“What do you want, Highserk soldiers?”</p>

<p>A few soldiers stand in the way. From the equipment they were wearing, I guessed that they were a combination of old Fellius, Myard, and Highserk soldiers. If Craist and Liberitoa, who looked like a fair of equipment, were added to the group, it would cover all the northern countries.</p>

<p>They were soft-spoken, but their appearance was alert. No wonder they were wary of him. The most important thing to keep in mind is that you should be prepared for a visit from unknown soldiers who are fully armed and ready to go.</p>

<p>“I came to ...... treat my eye and to see an old acquaintance.”</p>

<p>“That's--”</p>

<p>“It's -” “Ayane's guest, the Chief Protector of Walm.”</p>

<p>Moritz, whose face peeks out from the open doorway, speaks for him. From the look on his face, he seems to be a familiar face to the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Chief Protector, the Demon Fire user. Rumor has it.</p>

<p>“The luring fire of the underworld, huh?”</p>

<p>Unlike the Highserk soldiers who were happy to see him, Ferius and his Myard escort kept their eyes on him, as if they were looking at him with a price. It was not a favorable gaze, but it was somewhat easier to accept than being called by an itchy alias.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry, sir, but you are not allowed to bring weapons or anything else into the house.”</p>

<p>His glance led him to a set of shelves. It was a kind of urging. Walm obediently complies. He deposited the axe and spear on his shoulder, the sword at his waist, and several blades on the shelf. Considering his magic and skills, he could not completely eliminate the danger, but he could prevent it. Both arms are outstretched, palms exposed. I have no interest in having a man play with my body, but I am not so stubborn as to force myself to do so just because we are old acquaintances. It was necessary in light of her rare ability, and the same procedure was taken even with Walm, who was her escort and monitor at the time.</p>

<p>“I'm in the middle of a medical examination, so you'll have to wait a few moments.”</p>

<p>"That's okay. I'm used to waiting and making people wait."</p>

<p>After the treatment, some of the patients left the church. Their steps were light. From the waiting room, one person comes in, then another, then another, and so on. I wonder how many times this happened. A soldier stands beside them and gives them an earful.</p>

<p>“Inside, please.”</p>

<p>Walm exhaled and was invited in. Bunks are lined up and treatment equipment decorates the room. The air is filled with the familiar smoke of incense. A girl stood in the room. She looks a little more mature than I remember. Walm is struggling with words to say, but the girl says without hesitation, "Welcome home.</p>

<p>"Welcome home.</p>

<p>“Ah, I'm back ...... late.”</p>

<p>Walm replies to Ayane, looking embarrassed. Not many words were needed.</p>

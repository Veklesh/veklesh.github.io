<p>Episode 57</p>

<p>The body is heavy like lead. The blood rushing through her lungs for oxygen mixed with the exhaled air and became bitter, affecting her oral cavity. Even so, Ayane kept running. If she stopped at a place like this, she would not be able to face the people who had sent her off. The only thing she could do, helpless as she was, was to run away.</p>

<p>“Phew, phew ...... hah, hah.”</p>

<p>The girl's armor, which was not suited to her physique, swayed at will, agitating her internal organs. The discomfort that resonates to the core is like intoxication. I can't believe I'm making a sound after running this far. At the same time as feeling self-loathing, words of praise also come to mind. I wonder how those who fight on the battlefield wear such heavy clothes and move around freely. My head, which was spinning in circles even in the midst of the lack of acidity, let my thoughts slide toward the negative. What happened to them? What will happen to them?</p>

<p>Ayane takes a short breath and stares at her buttocks, which are shaking in front of her. She has to concentrate on running now. Her pulse and breathing are racing. Don't think about it. She repeats the question to herself, denial and affirmation. I felt that it would be a little easier if I just let my consciousness fly without thinking about anything. But that too comes to an abrupt end.</p>

<p>“It's not that easy, is it?”</p>

<p>Moritz, who had never said a word before, muttered to himself in a self-mocking tone. Ayane had been running along his backside, just as he had said. That is why she did not even notice the signs. The liaison, with his hands around his waist, flashed his weapon. From behind a tree, a Craist soldier fell down with a grunt.</p>

<p>“Enemy soldiers, they're coming through!”</p>

<p>"Thorough, isn't it?</p>

<p>One half of the paired soldiers was blocking the path. It seemed that the Royal Army of Craist was not going to let anyone escape from the treatment center. The liaison officer followed the corpses that had been formed after several sword fights. It seemed like an unnecessary sacrifice. But as a matter of fact, the interference was quite effective.</p>

<p>“Huh, are they living Naruko?”</p>

<p>“They're skilled, don't let your guard down.”</p>

<p>Three soldiers stared at Ayane. Familiar and familiar armor. It was the knight of Reharzen and his squires.</p>

<p>"I'm a little tired of running. Go ahead, please. I'll kick your asses, I'll show you three of them."</p>

<p>It was that face again. Ayane was about to say something, but the liaison officer shot out a shout and spirit that crushed it.</p>

<p>“Reharzen's knights and squires, there is no shortage of opponents!”</p>

<p>The backs of the men who are rushing to the battle are separated from the man who is rushing to the battle. This was to give Ayane no time to worry, and at the same time, to take the lead and aid and abet her escape.</p>

<p>"One, let's get away!</p>

<p>“Ugh, this guy...”</p>

<p>Don't get distracted, I'll kill him first."</p>

<p>Ayane had once started to run, but turned around at the sound of a familiar voice moaning. Moritz was exhausted and was doing everything he could to be. Like a burning candle. Blood drips from his limbs and he takes a hard blow through his breastplate. You know you can't hold on much longer.</p>

<p>“...... no good, and yet, no good.”</p>

<p>Running a few steps, Ayane finally stops. I don't know why I reached for the ground, I don't know myself. She tossed it in her hand, carried away in a frenzy. The pebble parabolized with such force that it could not even kill an insect. A clattering, off-beat, high-pitched sound echoed out of place, and the time between them as they slashed at each other came to a halt for a moment.</p>

<p>“Haha, I hit it!”</p>

<p>Ayane has no experience in throwing a projectile. The closest she had come was throwing a handball at an athletic test. She was a good thrower, slamming the ball into the ground with all her might. It was a miracle that she hit the ground. It was a miracle that it hit the ground. It was an indescribable sense of accomplishment. I was filled with regret that I had done it.</p>

<p>"......What is it, little girl? Do you want to die so quickly?"</p>

<p>The knight who was drained glared at the lackey. The squire, who reacted belatedly, realized the girl's true identity.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute. That's Ayane.</p>

<p>"That's an unexpected blessing. You should have just run away."</p>

<p>The knight with a lecherous smile slowly approached.</p>

<p>"Ayane-sama, what!</p>

<p>Moritz, whose life was tied to the knight's, went to intercept him, but the squires would have none of it.</p>

<p>“You, stay there and watch Ayane die.”</p>

<p>What would I say to everyone who saved me and let me go? The girl knows she did something stupid. She knows that. She knows that her puny body is not going to solve anything. Still, she couldn't abandon someone who was about to be killed in front of her eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't you pull it out? A sword is not a decoration."</p>

<p>“Yeah, ugh, ugh...”</p>

<p>He tried to grab the sword he was given for protection, but it slipped through the air. Ayane gripped the hilt after two pointless swings, but the blade was stuck in the scabbard and she was unable to pull it out. She only made a clattering sound. The knight said in disgust, "That's enough.</p>

<p>"That's enough. Die like that."</p>

<p>In the end, the sword did not pull out. Cowering in the face of impending death. His sense of balance, deranged by his predicament, turned his footing into a quagmire, and he was unable to step back.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>A bloody wind blew out from his back. The smell of death was as thick as it could be. Had the god of death come to witness her death? Even so, Ayane was too terrified to turn around. The knight of Reharzen, whose appearance had changed drastically, bellowed.</p>

<p>"The cavalry is coming, run alone!</p>

<p>The sword crossed with the shadow that had grown slimy from his back. It clashes overhead, striking the eardrums with a caustic force that tears at the air. While the knight of Reharzen is thrown back by the impact, the man who jumped down from the horse's back approaches the knight in the uppermost stance.</p>

<p>"Come on!　Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!"</p>

<p>The axe-head, clad in magic power, slashes at the raised sword, cutting the body in two with the entire helmet. Unlike the first blow, the dignified and clear sound was even tinged with a kind of beauty. Blood spurts out from the body that the axe spear sliced through. The spilled organs bloom on the ground. Demon Masks, which were being dyed by the red rain that was pouring down, were dry and sipped vermilion.</p>

<p>"Ha, Highserk knight! Are you really a person?</p>

<p>“Don't be frightened, take them out!”</p>

<p>Leaving the wounded liaison behind, the squires challenge the man. Their step and sword strokes were in perfect alignment, reminding even Ayane, who is not familiar with martial arts, of the days they must have spent accumulating their skills. The precise coordination, like that of a demonstration, was broken down by a single, casual thrust. The half-step gap between the two is not corrected, but is instead made even more frenzied by the axe spear that intervenes.</p>

<p>Trails of blood float in the void, as if they were red threads. One is hit in the carotid artery by a branch blade. Another is pierced through the eye socket with the tip of a spear. In the end, it did not take more than the fingers of both hands to pile up the bodies. Despite such a bloody and gruesome scene, Ayane was relieved, though it was hard to admit.</p>

<p>“Ayane-sama first, this is nothing to worry about.”</p>

<p>Moritz, who had avoided a fatal wound, called out to the imperial knight.</p>

<p>"Ayane, are you okay?</p>

<p>The Highserk knight - Walm - rushes over to her, his mask off. He must have thought she was wounded, as she slumped to the ground with her back to the ground. Ayane shakes her head repeatedly to show that she is safe.</p>

<p>“Injured is--”</p>

<p>Walm looked at his outstretched arm as he called out and pulled it back with a reluctant face. Then he tried to wipe his blood-stained hand with his clothes. Ayane forcefully took hold of the folded arm. The knight was unusually flustered, and his Demon Mask trembled in frustration. No matter how bloody it was, it was Ayane's irreplaceable salvation. There was no reason to hesitate.</p>

<p>“......Where have you not been cut?”</p>

<p>In the gruesome battlefield, the care for others to wipe their dirty hands. He must have kept himself in the midst of the ravages of war, which distorts even values and principles, and in this way he has been scraping away at the seaweed.</p>

<p>“Walm, Mr. Walm, Mr. Walm!”</p>

<p>"What's wrong, does it hurt?</p>

<p>That's why. Surely, for him, even these words could be a curse. Still, Ayane wished for the knight.</p>

<p>“Save everyone, save everyone!”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>Without calculation or hesitation, the knight responded to the girl's earnest wish.</p>

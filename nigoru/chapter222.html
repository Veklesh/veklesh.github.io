<p>Episode 67</p>

<p>Walm exhaled a puff of purple smoke from between his dry lips and stared off into the distance, doing nothing. He takes a sip or two, and a wavering white smoke rises from the cigarette left on his finger. The ash, pulled by gravity, crumbled to the ground in tatters. The sun was melting into the horizon of the long Celta Lake, and the too-long day of the imperial knight was coming to an end.</p>

<p>It was exhausting to let out emotions. I never thought that at my age, I would be exhausted from crying - and with a girl holding me in her arms. I can only mock myself for my own pettiness. But strangely enough, I did not feel disgusted. There was no heaviness clinging to my body and mind, only pure exhaustion. In a sense, it was even pleasant.</p>

<p>Fighting, running, and fighting again. The body, coated with layers of fatigue, urges us to abandon our duties for a time. Leaving myself in the rubble created by the battle, my consciousness wavers with the setting sun. Walm wanders the boundary between consciousness and unconsciousness, but the presence of people brings him back to reality.</p>

<p>The footsteps, keeping a steady directional pattern, approach the imperial knight. Walm, who had been staring at the figure, saw through the visitor's identity.</p>

<p>"Hey ......, long time no see, huh? It's a mess, but, well, have a seat."</p>

<p>He brushes away the debris littering the floor of the abandoned house and invites the figure to join him. It was dirty, but still classy in the aftermath of the war around Cape Raga. The guest did not hesitate to sit down face to face and spoke the words.</p>

<p>“What, you look better than I thought you would.”</p>

<p>It was Jose, one of the members of Duwei's squad, with whom he had once shared the battlefield. I felt an irresistible surge of joy and nostalgia. His dark skin blends in with the darkness, and his appearance is not so different. A thin smile that could be considered cheerful or frivolous, depending on who you ask. But to Walm, with whom he had shared many hardships and joys, it was a backward-looking cheerfulness that came from a sense of mastery and resignation.</p>

<p>“Were you worried about me?”</p>

<p>"That's right. I mean, you know, an old friend of mine was going around killing people with a bad side. You must be a little concerned. Well, it was a wasted concern."</p>

<p>The counterattack from Cape Raga included an Imperial light infantry company that had attacked from the water. Just as Walm had recognized his old friend on the battlefield, Jose would have recognized him as well.</p>

<p>"I gave you a lot of trouble. Is everything okay over there?"</p>

<p>"Hey, have you forgotten?　I'm an opportunist who gets swept away when the wind blows. I don't stand on my feet, so I won't break."</p>

<p>When I thanked Jose for his trouble, he fluttered his wrists and seemed to be oblivious to the situation. But he wasn't smiling at the deepest corner of his eye.</p>

<p>"...... That's great. Smoke, it's a gift from Battalion Commander Jaff."</p>

<p>With a gesture of exertion, Walm pulls a cigarette out of his pocket. It was a fine product, different from the inferior soldier cigarettes he usually smokes down.</p>

<p>"That's worth smoking. I'll be your companion. It's a cheap drink, but give me a break. I picked it up from the ship I was on."</p>

<p>Jose points with his chin at the floating wreckage of a burned-out ship. Walm nodded in agreement. A bottle of liquor had fallen onto the ship they happened to be on, and the ship they happened to be on caught fire. No evidence was left behind and there was no aftermath.</p>

<p>“As usual, you're on point.”</p>

<p>Procuring two half-broken cups from the rubble, the Highserk soldierly revelry was complete. There was no toast, no signal of celebration. They simply sipped their drinks as they pleased. There was no sense of gloom. They drank as they would in everyday life, and engaged in conversation as they would in everyday life. From lowly conversation to complaining and talking about hardships, they seemed to be in tune with each other without feeling the passage of time.</p>

<p>The conversation, which continued like breathing, was not eternal. Suddenly, they stopped. They must have sensed each other's presence. It was Jose who broke the silence.</p>

<p>"...... Captain Duwei has kind of stepped over the line, you know. You know, the one you can't go back to once you've crossed it."</p>

<p>Walm had an idea of what his old friend was talking about. The confusion and fear of having what constituted his goodness crumble. Walm did not overcome this with a strong will. He just happened to step over the line.</p>

<p>“The squad leader - no, the company commander is .......”</p>

<p>Jose continued speaking on behalf of the imperial knight, who was struggling with his choice of words.</p>

<p>"You saw the skin. That's the one of the dead squad members. Noor, Barito, Willart. And many others. Maybe it was part of the cure, but if you ask me, it's become a curse. Think about it. You wake up in the morning, you look into the water to wash your face, and you see the skin of your dead men."</p>

<p>The words were cut off as if to say, "Imagine that. A traumatic memory is not something that can be erased by half-hearted hope or healing. They only fade with the passage of time.</p>

<p>“It won't rest for years,” he said. Instead of fading, the memories will become fixed and stronger."</p>

<p>"Yeah, you're right. Duwei is the same as he was then. He's been living through the war all along. In fact, once you cross the line, it snowballs. He has added hanged criminals, violators of military discipline, and bad behavior to his ranks one after another."</p>

<p>Walm realized the true nature of the disfigured Imperial soldiers who had lined up at Cape Raga. A special unit, in the bad sense of the word, that gathered criminals and violators of orders. It was a kind of punishment squad. Duwei was the pinnacle of the unit, made up of probationers who had been given a last chance.</p>

<p>"If it were a normal unit, it would fall apart, but it's so strong that it's ridiculous. He is strong like a fool, and he doesn't choose any means. And he's very good at taking care of them. They were just going to be used up, but they found a way to make use of Duwei. In the underground war with Liberitoa after the Great Outbreak, he went on quite a rampage. Sometimes they even blamed it on demons. He also has a good cover story. There were a number of them who enjoyed playing with corpses. To them, it was no different than playing in the sand. It's just sand or flesh."</p>

<p>Grabbing a handful of gravel, Jose laughed uninterestedly and showed off his playful side.</p>

<p>"And so the congenitally and acquired looseheads and avenging demons gathered together. A company of heretics, heretics who are outcasts even from among the whispering barbarians of the Empire. Well, I'm saying this, but I'm getting used to it. I miss the Ligurian Battalion. The squadron was the same, and Platoon Commander Kozl was rough around the edges, but he was good to the point. It was all war, but I felt right at home."</p>

<p>After he had finished talking a lot, Jose slurped his drink and asked.</p>

<p>"Hey, Walm. Hey, Walm, can you still fight?　Are you going to fight?"</p>

<p>The taut smile was gone.</p>

<p>“What's wrong with you, asking that?”</p>

<p>"I've always thought you weren't cut out to be a soldier. No, you're much better at killing people than I am. You are the best in the Imperial Guard. But you're too serious. You can't go on like this, or you'll cross a line you can't come back from. Like a squad leader."</p>

<p>Was all that lengthy preamble concern and advice? Walm couldn't resist letting out a small gasp.</p>

<p>“Hmm, you're the one who's being very serious, aren't you?”</p>

<p>“Damn, don't laugh at me and make fun of me.”</p>

<p>Jose's mouth twisted as if he was being unfaithful. There was probably some shame mixed in. There was no fake smile there.</p>

<p>"My bad. Give me a break. ...... I certainly don't want to cross the line. I'm not even sure I can go back to the way things were. But hey. I can't leave the people I know, the land, knowing that they'll be unhappy."</p>

<p>"Ha, I'm stunned. You're a softy, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Not really. I didn't do anything. I just don't want to be crushed by regret and guilt for not doing anything. You know, in the archipelagos I was drunk all year long. I drank enough booze to last a lifetime."</p>

<p>"That's good. That's good,“ he said. ”Was it good?</p>

<p>Walm shakes his head in denial, though his old friend looks at him with envy.</p>

<p>"I don't remember any of that. I was pouring it down my esophagus."</p>

<p>"What a waste. I hope next time I can drink it for the rest of my life with my memory intact."</p>

<p>“Yeah, right.”</p>

<p>I didn't know what Jose was really saying. Still, it was not Walm who did not know why he was being told this. He was being urged to flee in a roundabout way. From the war. If not encouraged by a fellow girl, that might have been one option.</p>

<p>But Walm did not flee. Jose, too, was tactless and made no further mention of it. They genuinely celebrated, talked, and drank with their old friend. It was also a time of mourning for the squad members who had sunk to the depths of memory. The anguish and pain that he could never have faced alone could be digested in the stories he shared with Jose. Mourning the dead at the site of a battlefield surrounded by corpses. With a great contradiction.</p>

<p>Early in the morning of the next day, there was an urgent report from the imperial capital through the communication grimoire. A major invasion of the Liberitoa Trade Federation against the imperial territory. Although there were those who distorted their faces at the news, no one was surprised.</p>

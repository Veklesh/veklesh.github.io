<p>Episode 53</p>

<p>“Don't be lazy, get out of here.”</p>

<p>“Well, wait a minute, just this once--”</p>

<p>"No exceptions!　You can give up the wagon and all your belongings. Or you can stay here with us!</p>

<p>The residents, unable to give up their possessions, plead with him, but the soldier pushes him off his back. This is a very high-handed attitude toward the people of an allied country. But it was necessary. Considering the situation, it was only a matter of time before they threatened him with weapons. If the enemy forces caught up with them, they would lose their lives with their cargo. Friug strongly ordered his soldiers to make the townspeople throw away everything but the baggage they could carry. This was all due to the surprise attack from the lake by Craist's army.</p>

<p>The location where Friug's company is currently waiting is on the transportation route connecting Cape Raga and the military port city of Ancushio, and functions as a lodging town in times of peace. The town had been half confiscated as barracks when the war with the Royal Army of Craist broke out, but many residents still remained. The Myard soldiers who had fled the city were then swept into the town, and for a time it was in a state of disorder.</p>

<p>"Some of them don't even have swords, let alone spears or shields.</p>

<p>"For the time being, I don't care about equipment or affiliation. At any rate, put the surviving non-commissioned officers together in squads. Otherwise, we won't be able to give them instructions.</p>

<p>The generals, including Friug, were used to quieting the chaos and untangling the entangled people in Dandurg. They led the inhabitants inland and sent out wounded soldiers as sheepdogs. The evacuation continues even now, but not as turbulent as at first, flowing out of the inn, as solemnly as a river.</p>

<p>“Lord Commander, a messenger soldier has arrived from Cape Raga!”</p>

<p>"I thought it was about time. Call them over here."</p>

<p>We had received fragmentary information from the defeated soldiers, but we were far from having a complete picture. The messenger who rushed to the scene was spewing out information as if to say, "I've got a lot of information. The town was strangely quiet, with Friug in the center. The young Myard soldier, his face tense, awaits a response to the order he read out orally.</p>

<p>"Certainly received. My company will form a second line behind Cape Raga in accordance with your orders. Well done, you have delivered it."</p>

<p>Friug responded briefly to the dull-faced young man. His complexion, instead of clearing up, became increasingly clouded.</p>

<p>"...... I am just a messenger. It's just that this order is too--"</p>

<p>Myard people are a bit muddled, perhaps it's a national trait. In peacetime, this would be a virtue called consideration, but it is not appropriate for Highserk soldiers in wartime. Friug spoke his mind in a straightforward manner.</p>

<p>"Is it miserable?　Yes, it would be nothing short of reckless for our company to prevent the main force of Craist's army, even for a moment."</p>

<p>The face of the messenger turned red and blue. Words and actions that could be taken as an accusation against the command, or worse, even the defection of an entire unit. However, from the information he had digested and the text of the order, Friug sensed the anguish of the brigade commander Justus. The lady of Myard had sent it to him jointly with the name of the empire. Friug was not so foolish as not to realize how critical the situation was.</p>

<p>"I've become a little bit mean, haven't I? Quickly turn back to Cape Raga, it will be urgent to get back to the command center. Rest assured, the enemy main force will not let you through. Even if they burn our lives."</p>

<p>The rare communication magic equipment was placed only at key points in Rokkou. It was too much for a mere light infantry company. That is why a messenger is always useful. He must make it to Cape Raga in one piece.</p>

<p>“Good luck!”</p>

<p>The messenger soldier runs off after a long agony. He will be a good soldier after a lot of real combat and training. But he is not in a position to worry about his future. Friug throws a message to the soldiers gathered in the main street of the inn town.</p>

<p>"As you have heard, we will defend the town until reinforcements arrive. If they are overtaken at once, it will open the way to the interior. If that happens, the fall of the military port city is certain, which is tantamount to the destruction of Myard. Sandwiched between Craist and Liberitoa, the empire will be crushed this time after agony. This is our battlefield. Do not think of us as mere neighbors. The fall of Celta is the fall of Highserk."</p>

<p>“......I understand the intention and the significance, but isn't it too much to ask in reality?”</p>

<p>The old junior officer complained bitterly in response to the instruction. He is an old and strong man who has survived to this point after countless hardships. Friug understands from his long association with him that it is not just a matter of sparing his life.</p>

<p>"If you add up the company and those who were defeated, there are six hundred men, but these men have abandoned their weapons. Are you going to make them carry a piece of stick?"</p>

<p>The junior officer indicated, with a look of dismay on his face, that there were Myard soldiers standing there, looking dismayed. Warriors and weapons were the standard items given up in a losing battle. Unlike the front line, there were no spare weapons stored in the inn towns. Soldiers who had a habit of losing were already in trouble before that. They had to change their mindset.</p>

<p>“Can you fight for your hometown and family when you once abandoned even your weapons and ran away?”</p>

<p>The Highserk man's words sounded like a gentle admonition, but in fact they were provocative and arrogant. The Myard generals frowned bitterly and bit their lips. Some of them do not hide their indignation and try to kill Friug with a glare. It was a much preferable attitude to being wailed on.</p>

<p>“If we run away, our country will be destroyed ...... and we can't run away while the strangers in Highserk fight.”</p>

<p>The most senior officer among the defeated soldiers spoke for the group. At this stage of the game, he would have to be puffed up with rage to be of any use. Friug proceeded to confirm the feeling.</p>

<p>“Are you enthusiastic enough?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I'm not sure I can do it with my bare hands.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Friug does not have the materials to deny his subordinate's mischievous comment.</p>

<p>“Mm, that's true.”</p>

<p>Something had to be done. Friug moves around dizzily, looking around the inn town. In addition, he thought of the Craist soldiers he had confronted at the retreat at the border.</p>

<p>They would be motivated by the rewards and punishments and by looting. In addition, the organizational structure with knights at the top tended to increase the authority of individuals, and once a commander became convinced, his vision tended to become narrow-minded. Taking these factors into consideration, he floated several ideas and decided to make one move.</p>

<p>“Good, then let's just get rid of the armor.”</p>

<p>They understood the meaning of the words immediately, though not very loudly. It was a great shock to the Myard soldiers when they were told to strip naked in the social setting of the battlefield.</p>

<p>“What are you doing ......?”</p>

<p>"Which company commander?</p>

<p>Do you want us to die?"</p>

<p>They had been so disheartened, but now they were quite animated. Friug, who did not withdraw his opinion, was not pleased, and one of his subordinates complained.</p>

<p>“Captain Friug, where is your serious self?”</p>

<p>Alas, lamentably, the subordinate shook his head exaggeratedly.</p>

<p>"I am not desperate, but I do not deny that I am strangely enjoying myself. Wouldn't you like to see a play, brethren?　I'd like a great comedy."</p>

<p>Friug explains to the bewildered crowd. There is not much time left. The actors must be chosen and the stage must be prepared by the time the play opens.</p>

<p>We have to decide who will play the roles and prepare the stage before the show starts.</p>

<p>"Go ahead, raise our banner in the port city!</p>

<p>The knight Liard of the Knights of Reharzen was entrusted with the honor of spearheading the Royal Army of Craist. The order given to him, along with 800 soldiers, was simple enough. Defeat the opposing enemy forces and secure a place for the following forces to enter. The three clashes that occurred along the road according to the strategy were all one-sided victories, with frontal breakthroughs supported by appropriate formations and magic soldiers.</p>

<p>As far as the enemy was concerned, they were neither prepared nor prepared. The surprise attack from the lake was that effective. They were able to destroy Myard's forces individually with divine speed, and end everything without allowing them to make effective use of their strength. That was the goal of the Craist Kingdom army.</p>

<p>The group, which had won battle after battle, was about to enter a town. The defeated soldiers who had missed the target were expected to resist in the town, but there was not even a shadow of the enemy, let alone a hastily built position. Is this some kind of trap? The usual course of action was to rush in with a small number of soldiers and watch for a reaction, but it is also true that time is sometimes more valuable than magic silver.</p>

<p>“Posco, lead the troops ahead to the town.”</p>

<p>Liard made a move that was both reconnaissance and suppression. It was an effective reconnaissance by less than seventy men. It would be reasonable, considering the time and losses involved.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. And the supplies?</p>

<p>“I'll allow them until they're in my pocket.”</p>

<p>“Haaah!”</p>

<p>He kept his face down, but even through his back, I could tell he was smiling. Liard doesn't say that Posco is particularly lowly. Ransacking is the custom of warfare. From a purely military point of view, it slows down marching speeds due to the additional hassle and baggage of looting. However, the morale-boosting aspect cannot be ignored. The people need immediate rewards.</p>

<p>In fact, the generals ordered to stand by in front of the town look at them with envy. Posco's troops were the ones who showed an unwavering will to fight in the battle on the street. This would make it easier for the other units to understand their credibility and punishment. Soon after, there were screams throughout the town. The townspeople, with their bags on their backs and under their arms, began to flee like hares. The most conspicuous among them was a cart full of goods.</p>

<p>"Is he the innkeeper?　With that much cargo, it would be obvious that he would be trapped on the ground."</p>

<p>“Whoa, oh, you guys, push quickly.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, it's coming, it's coming, oh oh oh!”</p>

<p>The overloaded wagons, with their wheels buried in the dirt, were slowing down to less than a crawl. The loot has been deliberately packed up. Soldiers swarm over the finest prey. Among them was Posco. He is sending out instructions to his subordinates.</p>

<p>“Don't let the pusher get away, he definitely has money and goods hidden.”</p>

<p>Even in the face of imminent danger, the cart pushers' movements were slow. If they abandoned their cargo and scattered along the path, one or two lives might be spared. Still, they abandon their thoughts and continue to push the carts in a foolish manner. Perhaps it was because of his master's popularity, but Liard could almost feel a certain admiration for their obstinacy.</p>

<p>“Damn you, you ran away and scattered.”</p>

<p>“Don't waste your time stabbing it and contaminating it, it's going to be a pain in the ass to find.”</p>

<p>Liard suddenly felt uncomfortable. Even though the soldiers were heavy in armor, not a single one of them had been cut down yet, even though there were so many townspeople running away. The pushers' attachment to the carts was bizarre. It was as if they were ordered not to abandon the cart. The raised blade was about to reach the defenseless cart.</p>

<p>“Call back the posse!”</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Liard's angry voice caused the soldiers at his side to yell dumbly, wondering what they had done wrong. Soon after, there was an unfamiliar order in the inn town, followed by screams and blood.</p>

<p>"Hang on!</p>

<p>“Ugh, giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!”</p>

<p>“It's an ambush, gather round--geh, yeah.”</p>

<p>The soldiers, who had been on guard when they stormed the inn town, had become engrossed in playing shadow games with the townspeople and had dispersed. They could not be blamed for their stupidity. The pause between the pull and the cut was that exquisite.</p>

<p>“So that cart was the starting point.”</p>

<p>It was that cart that did it. It was the one that guided their gaze and counterattacked at the same time. The cart was covered with cloth, and armed soldiers were leaping out of it. Although they were caught off guard, the loss from the ambush was still acceptable. Drawing his sword, Liard shouted out.</p>

<p>"Attack! The Poskos have exposed the ambush!　If you want to get your reward, take out the enemy!</p>

<p>It was a matter of saying the right thing. The hapless fall of the Poskos did not go unnoticed by all the officers and men. Their lives would be put to good use. The enemy army also formed up on the main street of the inn town. From this point on, it was a battle of strength against strength. Following the command of Liard, who was filled with a magical membrane, the army advanced at a gallop.</p>

<p>The line was chewed up by the magical firefight, and the distance between them was shortened. At last, the ears of the spears collided with each other. It was a moment later. A roar echoes through the inn. It was the sound of destruction brought by the familiar attack magic, but instead of ending, it was a chain of sounds changing. The inns that lined the streets of the inn town were collapsing, one after another, raising dust.</p>

<p>“Houses are collapsing!”</p>

<p>Liard grasped the situation with surprise. There was no way that the buildings could collapse in one fell swoop with a mere attack by mere mage soldiers. If they could, they would have projected directly into the ranks. Probably, the attack magic was a no-go, and they were using axes to plant themselves on the main beams and pillars of the selected buildings. Some of the soldiers were caught in the collapse and became trapped underneath. But that was a side effect. The real aim was...</p>

<p>“Have we been split up?”</p>

<p>The lead group of about 200 people, including Liard, was left behind behind behind the rubble. It was not the weak soldiers of Myard. They realized the true nature of their enemy, the skill with which they had used their town and their friends without hesitation, and their sophisticated group behavior.</p>

<p>“Highserk soldiers!”</p>

<p>“You will die here, Knight of Reharzen.”</p>

<p>The Highserk general nonchalantly tells Liard how much time he has left to live.</p>

<p>"Hmph, you're after me - or all of us. You greedy Highserk."</p>

<p>The aim is simple: to divide and then hunt the head Liard. Did he pretend that he had used up all of his resources with the Poskos? No, perhaps they would have used up their double trap if they had attacked with their entire army. In addition, behind the column, disguised soldiers stripped the corpses of their armor. This series of movements also served to procure armor from the destroyed Posco unit. What do we call this if not greed?</p>

<p>"Protect Mr. Liard!</p>

<p>“Quick, take it down.”</p>

<p>On a different battlefield, it would have been a good idea to take a stand and regroup. But in this situation, wasting time is the enemy's gain. The inability to fight on the high road was the reason they turned the inn town into rubble. The knight of Craist was convinced of this. He fell for the ruse, but what was a general for, what was a knight for, if he did not find a way out of a tight situation? If he turned his back on the Highserk soldiers, he would simply die.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool. Get over the rubble and strike down the enemy!"</p>

<p>With the knight's words as a start, the two armies exchanged blows. The battle for the inn town opened with a comedy performed by the Highserk forces.</p>

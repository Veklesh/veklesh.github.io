<p>Episode 13</p>

<p>Dandurg Castle, the exit on the Myard side of the Flame Dragon Corridor, houses tens of thousands of people in times of war, and in peacetime, it is a logistics hub where people and goods come and go.</p>

<p>In such an old castle, the members of the light infantry company led by Friug take a rest for the day. The company commander, who is the leader of the company, has given them a brief period of freedom, with the exception of the unlucky sentinel, who is on guard duty. They have several options. The main ones are to take care of their armaments and personal effects, to prevent marching sickness, and to get the sleep they lack. Those are not bad options. They would have been free to move on, if it were not for the old castle called a city that contained stores and dwellings.</p>

<p>They will vent their pent up greed with the swelling of their modest wallets. They must believe it is their duty to do so, and the inhabitants of the castle, who are engaged in business within the castle, will not miss the opportunity to do so. In the city of Saria, Walm was one of the soldiers who enjoyed the freedom he was given. He was extremely embarrassed by the freedom of action that he had long since forgotten existed, but in terms of humanity, the three fools were probably better and healthier than he was.</p>

<p>The soldiers, scattered inside and outside the old castle, were acting as they pleased by the time they were to assemble. The exceptions were the soldiers on duty and their commander, Captain Friug. Even though they were in an area controlled by an ally, there was always a chance that something might go wrong. It would be laughable if the commander could not be found in the middle of a fun-filled day in an emergency. Friug had to inform the soldiers on duty of his destination. The freedom he had finally obtained was only pitiful because it was a meeting with two large men in a closed room. Fleck, the host of the meeting, gave a detailed greeting and said, "I used to be a soldier.</p>

<p>“I used to think I didn't know who would become a soldier, but here we are.”</p>

<p>The man says self-mockingly. Walm generally agrees, but the ex-adventurer in front of him is a real soldier. It is no coincidence, after all, that the former company of light infantrymen was burned by defeated soldiers and adventurers in the border forests. Drafted into the militia, they have proven their usefulness in the defense of Dandurg. They were able to inspire those around them while tenaciously burying demons.</p>

<p>"Don't be so down on yourself. It suits you well."</p>

<p>“Stop it, are you trying to seduce me?”</p>

<p>Walm whispers softly, as if he is flattering a lady at a ball, and the former adventurer closes the one eye left over from the battle.</p>

<p>“I would throw words of sincerity at you if you were to fall for me.”</p>

<p>Friug, who was present, suggests in a serious tone. It was an invitation to join the Highserk Imperial Army, but the earnest company commander was not so sure. It was doubtful how far he was joking.</p>

<p>"If it's a young lady, who would be swayed by two guys coming on to her? Besides, it's better that they're not enemies."</p>

<p>The ex-adventurer's words clearly described the relationship between the two.</p>

<p>“...... as far as Fleck is concerned.”</p>

<p>“That's a loaded way of putting it.”</p>

<p>“To be honest, it bothers me to talk about it, but I can't say it's not related to past grudges.”</p>

<p>He goes on to give details of an ambush by the Liberitoa Trade Federation that took place in his hometown. Fleck is by no means uninvolved. After all, one of the attackers included a former party member. Unlike back then, Walm learned about adventurers and parties in the labyrinthine city. He therefore understands the principles and pride of an adventurer better than he did before. If we were to translate it to the military, their individual connections are deeper as a small elite group than as a large number of comrades-in-arms who share a battle line or squadron.</p>

<p>“Oh, so those guys escaped to Liberitoa.”</p>

<p>The emotion in his voice is impossible to gauge. Waiting for the next word without rushing it, Fleck let slip a few words.</p>

<p>"I'm going to make a mixed guess. Shortly after Highserk's victory at Sarajevo Fortress, a prominent adventurer was approached. Simply put, he would be our guide."</p>

<p>“Leading the rear occupations and ranger battles?”</p>

<p>These adventurers had a record of threatening the Highserk Imperial Army's rear lines of communication in the early days of the war. It was no surprise that they were once again being tapped for the job. But the reply was different from what Walm had expected.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. It was the Daimon Territory that asked for guidance."</p>

<p>“Daima Territory ......, no way.”</p>

<p>Friug's expression became stern and distorted. Walm also silently demanded to speak.</p>

<p>"We fought with you guys, and we were stuck with deep wounds. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that we were cautious. Our homeland had suffered a crushing defeat, and even Felius, whom we had looked up to as our ally, was in such a mess. He, Leethia, must have been in a hurry. After the two disappeared, adventurers and soldiers from the four-nation alliance entered the demon territory, followed by the Great Outbreak. It can't be a coincidence. It was such a chaos. I doubt very few adventurers made it back alive, and even if they did, they kept their mouths shut in the face of that tragedy."</p>

<p>Walm, touched by a piece of the truth, remains silent and lost in thought. Friug is probably in the same boat. The Great Outbreak had fatally determined the fate of the empire. It is not clear whether the target was the Sarajevo fortress or the Highserk imperial army, which had Myard and Felius under its control. Nevertheless, the result was to destroy Felius and leave Highserk paralyzed. It is not something that can be overlooked. Fleck paused for a breath, as if searching through distant memories, and said.</p>

<p>“I don't know if Leethia and Lefty are not coming back because they have no face to match, or if they are responsible for indiscriminately sending so many people to their deaths, or if they resent Myard for joining forces with their enemies...”</p>

<p>Fleck, who had been monologuing in the front of his mind, lost his posture. The chair he was sitting on creaked and squeaked in protest as the load was applied to it.</p>

<p>"When I was a solo adventurer, it was easy. When I was a solo adventurer, it was easy. If I messed up, all I would lose was my life. But now that I'm in a party, the lives of my companions are more important. The longer I spent time with them, the more I felt that way. After I lost my party, I felt a terrible sense of loss. It faded as I became a soldier and started having subordinates and became busier, but in the end it just changed the subject of my grief."</p>

<p>Just as Walm learned about adventurers, Fleck learned about the military. The circumstances are close, just with different entrances.</p>

<p>"That time, I didn't fight through at the crucial moment. The result is the loss of both of us. I apologize from the bottom of my heart. I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Two years have passed since then. I've sorted it out. And it's mutual. The big ogre took Al out for no reason, and I couldn't save Amy either. The two who crossed over to Liberitoa could have been prevented if I, as the elder, had been concerned about them. ...... Al and Amy would laugh if they could see us two former enemies sentimentalizing each other like this."</p>

<p>A flowing silence, and Friug was the first to open his mouth.</p>

<p>“Let's continue the old story at night, at your bedside.”</p>

<p>"Don't talk about it like it's the banter between a man and a woman. It's not a story at all."</p>

<p>The air in the room hardened at his outlandish remark. Friug may have been trying to be considerate, but Walm couldn't help but laugh. Slightly later, the former adventurer also smiled.</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so. Let's follow Friug's company commander's recommendation and get back on track. The higher-ups have given us strict orders to enter the Celta Peninsula by waterway after we have supplied them with supplies. One warship and two medium-sized transports have been arranged."</p>

<p>“A fleet of ships is quite a welcome.”</p>

<p>"There are demons in Lake Celta, too. Craist's hero killed the lake dragon that was the master of the lake at the time, but the water is crawling with all sorts of demons. Recently, even the corpse of a medium-sized lake dragon that was devoured washed ashore."</p>

<p>"Dragon species, huh?　This is why the waterfront is so ...... punishing for aquatic demons. I hope they're okay."</p>

<p>The memory of the great capture on the Adelina is fresh. To add to that, even the sea kobolds came rushing in. Ships, which are combustible materials, are incompatible with Demon Fire. Even if you burn down the enemy, it's a complete disaster if you burn the ship as well.</p>

<p>"It is said that it is probably a territorial dispute of the same kind, but I am also a land specialist. I don't know the details. Even so, Celta's water magicians are among the most elite in the northern countries. They are different from Dandurg, which is constantly pulling out its troops. Even if we were up against a lake dragon, they would send us safely back to the peninsula."</p>

<p>"The reason why the Celta peninsula was kept in a blockade rather than invaded is because, in addition to its strategic location, the water mages were still alive and well. In fact, in some lakeshore areas, there were even counterattacks by a core force of Celta's water mages. They were a troublesome lot at the time, but not if they were friends."</p>

<p>The former adventurer tries to take back his gaffe, and the company commander accompanying him joins in. Walm was not helped by the two of them. He cannot even forcefully argue for the overland route because he is afraid of demons. As usual, it all comes down to this.</p>

<p>“By all means or no means?”</p>

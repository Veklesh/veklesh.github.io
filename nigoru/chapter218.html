<p>Episode 64</p>

<p>The surprise attack from the lakeshore led by the Knights of Reharzen fell apart with the ice road when the sword was thrust to the neck of the Kingdom of Myard. Trapped in a cage called the Celta Peninsula, the majority of the three thousand elite never set foot on the soil of their homeland again. The death of Knight Commander Gran, who was in overall command of the invasion, threw the wheels of Craist's army out of gear.</p>

<p>Half a day had passed since the siege at Cape Raga, and the remaining knights of Reharzen were trying their best to sort out the chaotic situation. After losing Gran and Cylance, the most senior knights, in quick succession, the overall command of the Myard-dispatched army slipped down to Lars, the third most senior knight in the succession of command.</p>

<p>“Renate and Efsei were both killed, and Hasse fell from the ice road and is not known to be alive ...... Magnus?”</p>

<p>“His burns worsened and he passed away just now.”</p>

<p>Who is the only senior knight left on the eastern end of the peninsula in good health?</p>

<p>Only Olof, who is deployed at Cape Raga, and Johanna, who has retreated from the lakeshore.</p>

<p>The knight roared as the commander, the head of the corps, was dispatched. Olof had his hands full commanding the offensive. Johanna, who excelled in individual combat, would handle any forces within sight, but no more than that. Even Lars, who was in charge of the entire army, was not suitable for his current position. As the most senior knight in charge of the Sarajevo fortress siege, his task was to cut off the enemy's lines of communication and prevent them from closing in from the outside.</p>

<p>Lash is proud of his ability to complete the siege of the fortress alone. However, when it comes to taking overall command of a dispatched army, the burden is immediately heavier. It is not a matter of personal qualities alone. If he had a unit and a commander at hand, things could still proceed smoothly. However, the generals who should be under command are scattered throughout the country, and command must be taken over from remote locations. The offensives at each of the six mouths were halted, and Lash had the female knight organize the followers who had failed to cross the ice road and the defeated soldiers.</p>

<p>“Can't you talk to Olof directly?”</p>

<p>"...... No. The communication is bad. I can't reach him. We have no choice but to relay the message to him."</p>

<p>"The Zelebes Mountains. Not only the soldiers, but also the voice is blocked?"</p>

<p>The communication magic tool that allows voices to reach all the way to the village is not a panacea. In addition to the heavy use of mage soldiers, rare mage tools are only deployed at a ratio of one per several thousand troops. In addition, the rugged outer line of the Zelebes Mountains is often inaccessible to voices. It took a lot of manpower to give orders to the subdivided, branching out units. The personnel that would normally be allocated only for the siege of the fortress were taken to seize control of the troops.</p>

<p>“If there was one more knight of the highest rank,......, or is it a request for something that doesn't exist?”</p>

<p>The four chairs of the deputy commander, one of which was lost during the Four Nations Alliance war, remain vacant. The vacant post's leader lost his life because he was a fierce general fighting on the front lines. The one who remains at home is a strong internal politician and can hardly be called a fighter. He could not be moved to prepare for the defense of the country in the first place.</p>

<p>"Many of the soldiers returning from the ice road have lost their weapons and armor, and captured and spare parts alone are insufficient. We are having equipment transported from the primary gathering point on the provisional border, but it will take time to rearm them."</p>

<p>"The Siege Force of the Lehun Mine has informed us that they are aware of Master Lash's succession of command. The army will continue to monitor and detain the mine garrison."</p>

<p>"The main fleet of the Liberitoa Trade Federation navy has left the battle zone. The fleet battle ended in a bitter draw. No support from the water is expected."</p>

<p>Communications are arriving in rapid succession from various sources informing us of the results of the battle and the current status of the situation. It is a tantalizing feeling of delayed communication. The uncertainty and lack of clarity of information is like a light fog hanging over the battlefield. Lash tries not to be distracted, but his face changes color at the bad news mixed in with the reports.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>Yes, I heard that the bodies of many knights, including the Knight Commander, were exposed on Kokuro-zaka. Two moments ago.</p>

<p>“You bastard!”</p>

<p>It's war. People die. That's the way it is. Lash had no intention of pretending to be a saint. But he couldn't stand the vileness of humiliating a corpse even after death.</p>

<p>"......This is not the way of the classy, cowardly Myards. It was put in by the Highserk."</p>

<p>I had an idea of the degrading practice of exposing corpses. Through the matchmaker of war, the Highserk empire and the Duchy of Myard are forming a honeymoon relationship. Trained in the crucible of war, the Highserk are clueless in both diplomacy and commerce, but they are adept at inciting the populace, especially their soldiers. They may be planning to display the bodies of their dead in various places as if on pilgrimage, in order to raise the war spirits of their allies and discourage the morale of their enemies.</p>

<p>“Deputy Commander Lars, there is urgent news from Kokurozaka.”</p>

<p>What is it this time?</p>

<p>"A group of Felius militiamen from Kokurozaka have betrayed us!　It is treason. A knight, Nikolaus the Magnificent, has been murdered.</p>

<p>"...... They want to do this? Crush them immediately!　Not a single rebel is left behind."</p>

<p>There was a hint of frustration in Lash's voice as he ordered the situation to be put down. The loss of a single senior knight was a blow in a situation where headmen were in short supply. But it was nothing to be distraught about. The real concern was.</p>

<p>"Kokurozaka, it's a massive counterattack by Myard!　We are losing our offensive."</p>

<p>“I knew it.”</p>

<p>Sudden commander killings. An accident that could have been caused by a personal grudge, distraction, or temper tantrum. It is still acceptable. The problem was that an organized counteroffensive by the enemy army was launched in conjunction with the rebellion. The poison of the Knight Commander's death in battle is turning.</p>

<p>“...... It seems that a rebellion has also broken out on Orzerica Hill.”</p>

<p>The communicator's voice echoed well into the tent. Lash shudders at the aftermath of the rebellion that is propagating. A decision must be made. He moves his dry lips and gives the order.</p>

<p>"We will temporarily abandon the Kokuro, Talmakane, and Asarina slopes. Retreat the westernmost units to the secondary rally points."</p>

<p>"Deputy Commander, what!　You're going to let Myard regroup without a fight!"</p>

<p>"Our numerical superiority has not yet been broken. The enemy has surrounded us on the basis of the division.</p>

<p>"Think again!　For what have we sacrificed so much?</p>

<p>The knights and warriors gathered in the military camp urged him to reconsider. Lars shook his head and refused their pleas.</p>

<p>"Have you forgotten that, despite our numerical superiority, half of the dispatched troops are former Felians? And we lost the majority of the elite directly under the Commander. Now they are no better than starving wolves with their collars removed."</p>

<p>Except for the units blockading Sarajevo and Refun, the Craist Royal Army attacking the Celta Peninsula has been reduced to 22,000. Of these, 8,000 are Craist, and the remaining 14,000 soldiers are made up of former Felians. Ten or twenty years would have been enough to achieve full incorporation. Resignation and reality made their consciousness belong to the Kingdom of Craist. But only two years have passed since the destruction of the kingdom of Ferius. It was too short a time to let them abandon the temperament that had seeped into their hearts.</p>

<p>The Duchy of Myard's forces at Rokkou had been reduced to about 9,000 men, and there was no sign of the defensive facilities that had been built in depth and breadth. However, if we limit ourselves to the Celta Peninsula, the difference in military strength between the six sides, excluding the Craists, was not even, but rather inferior. The Felians, who were not in a position to make a choice, for better or worse, if they knew they were in a position to influence the war situation. The Highserk would whisper sweetly that if they turned now, “only you” would be rewarded with the restoration of their old lands.</p>

<p>Naturally, they would weigh the prize against the territory promised by the Kingdom of Craist. Both are empty promises, but the insane love letter from the remains of the knight commander is undeniable. They would jump at it even if it were an exaggerated war result, a mixture of falsehoods and truths. The blank space in the command succession gave them just that much room to maneuver.</p>

<p>"There is no objection, is there?　We will reorganize the troops from Kokuro Hill, Talmakane Pass, and Asarina Hill and Johanna's units into one, and retighten the collars as a decisive force."</p>

<p>A decisive battle in the field and the striking of Rokkou are high hopes for the dispatched forces now. It was a complete afterthought. They would reorganize themselves into a single organization with a clear will. The last and most senior knight of the dispatched army had no objection. As one who stood at the top of the Reharzen Knights, Lars had a strong spirit and a clear vision. The only regret was the limitation of time and space. An element that has been coveted on the battlefields of old and new, the battle for Myard was no exception.</p>

<p>"Kyuho-ohoh!　From Sarajevo Fortress, the enemy army is on the move. ...... garrison, plus Jaff's cavalry battalion!</p>

<p>The previous bad news had been brought through a communication device. This time, however, it was delivered by a half-crazed observer. A powerful enemy had attacked, and he must be stopped with all his might. Lash kicked the chair he was sitting on and stood up as if he had been knocked off his feet.</p>

<p>"Where are they headed?</p>

<p>"Straight this way!　The outpost has already been eaten!"</p>

<p>Lash jumped out of his tent and stared at the Sarajevo fortress. The small hill from which he could see all around him gave him a clear view of the surroundings. A group of cavalrymen run past, as sharp as sharp swords. Dust and flames were billowing from the outposts they had built protruding into the fortress for surveillance.</p>

<p>"You evil eater. You're going to eat the command network I've rebuilt with me!"</p>

<p>In the decisive battle of Eidensberg, the headquarters of the commander, Winston Felius, was totally destroyed by the assault of Jaff's cavalry battalion. The Union of Felius Myard, which had the superior force, lost its head and was eaten up individually. They could not make the same mistake.</p>

<p>"Their front line is solidified with magic soldiers. If the vanguard collapses under attack magic, they will come prying out of there!　Pull the centurions over to us one by one from the right wing Yakop's corps and the left wing Henuri's corps. Let the Toshten cavalry in the rear poke them from the right wing when they bite us."</p>

<p>At Lars's order, the orderlies rush out to their various positions. The camp, which had been quiet since the beginning of the war, is engulfed in mayhem and heat.</p>

<p>The men and horses were closing in as if they were flying over the ground. Compared to the speed of the cavalry, the infantrymen on both flanks looked foolish. Soon the two armies clashed. Lash, who was waiting with bated breath to see what would happen, squinted at the shimmering light. It was a flash of attack magic from the cavalry. It shredded a portion of the horse-proof fence, sending the fill soaring to the sky. The friendly magic soldiers began to return fire. Contrary to the roar, the damage to both sides was minor. A sense of discomfort prevailed over a shrug of the shoulders.</p>

<p>"...... is far away. They must be getting impatient."</p>

<p>No, would they mistake their timing after only two years of peace? This fear was realized when the tip of the cavalry group turned at a right angle.</p>

<p>"Don't tell me ...... you're going to turn around and expose your belly in front of the enemy!　Let the infantry in the vanguard charge. Eat the tail end alone!"</p>

<p>The man-horse tilted like a juggling act, and not only the flanks, but even the lower belly of the warhorse could be seen. At Lash's order, the infantry in the vanguard rushed in, but their throwing spears and attack magic ended up only snatching the horses' tails. The simple movement of turning the horse's head made me feel the superior skill even if I did not want to feel it. It was so brilliant that one could even admire it.</p>

<p>"The Sarajevo garrison, consisting mainly of infantry, stopped in front. Jaff's cavalry is aiming for the Celta Peninsula on the left flank!</p>

<p>Lash's men were unable to move. If they were lured into action from their positions, the cavalry battalion might turn on their heels with the assault of the fortress garrison.</p>

<p>"Let the Thorsten cavalry charge. On the left is the Henuri Corps, which is defending a simple position. We'll pin them down!"</p>

<p>Jaff's cavalry battalion gallops to lick the simple position, a kind of fortification against the fortress. Neither projectiles nor attack magic could reach them in the slightest.</p>

<p>“Don't tell me you're probing?”</p>

<p>And just as if he had found a favorite food, he twisted his path. The target was one of the field positions surrounding Sarajevo that had been delayed in construction. It was no coincidence. They were observant and had found a vital spot.</p>

<p>The Haenuri, who were defending their position to the death, tried to counterattack. The cavalrymen who were hit by arrows fell as if they had stumbled over stones, and a part of the leading group was gouged out by the fangs of attack magic. But they were not intimidated. They simply waited for the signal as their horses fell over.</p>

<p>When they were within six horse lengths of the position, the enemy battalion commander's order must have been given. The cavalry battalion unleashed its attack magic at once. The power of the magic was fundamentally different from that of the scare magic displayed in front of Lash's eyes.</p>

<p>“The greeting you just gave me was a deception that included magic?”</p>

<p>The horse-proof fence was blown away at its base, and the fill was scattered with blood mist. The infantrymen, who were supposed to be protected by the position, exposed their defenseless bodies to the cavalrymen.</p>

<p>A breakthrough of twenty-five meters in width was formed. That alone was enough space for them. The infantry that had formed a line of spear beds were all ignored. The scattered soldiers were crushed, and even the units that succeeded in getting in the way were carefully overrun by attack magic and rushes.</p>

<p>There were no obstacles to block their way. Leaving the pursuing infantry behind, they have gained their freedom as a military unit. The only hope that remained was the light cavalry led by senior knight Thorsten. The cavalry, which had set out late, pursued hard with all its might to eat the tail end of Jaff's cavalry battalion. A battle between cavalrymen. If they could restrain them even a little, even the infantry would be able to cover them in time.</p>

<p>"Send in the Henuri Corps, regardless of their position!　The infantry-based fortress garrison will be taken care of by Jacob and us."</p>

<p>There is no value in sticking to a position that has escaped encirclement. The Haenuri Corps, which left the left flank position, pursued the cavalry. Although Haenuri's corps was allowed to break through, the majority of its fighting strength was still intact. The hands on the horse fences were naturally filled with strength. This was the critical moment.</p>

<p>"What?</p>

<p>The lead of Jaff's cavalry battalion, which had confirmed the approach of the Toshten cavalry, split into two halves like a two-headed serpent, and coil around. The Craist cavalrymen, not wanting to be dispersed, were eagerly ready to slash at the head first, but they were easily repelled by the cavalrymen's discernment of their path. Like children playing with shadows, they chase after each other, but their tips never cross each other.</p>

<p>"What is Toshten-dono doing?</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm not trying to catch eels. How could he run away at that distance?</p>

<p>The strong knights gathered in the military camp screamed in a childish tone of voice in frustration. Immediately after two or three repetitions, the remaining twin heads that had branched off bit the Craist cavalryman in the side.</p>

<p>“Not that way, cut back to the left!”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, you'll get flanked!”</p>

<p>There was no way his voice could reach them without a communication grimoire. In front of the eyes of the knights of Reharzen, the Toshten cavalry was hit hard. They are not inexperienced by any means, as they maintain a distorted formation and try to regain their footing while writhing in agony. Still, from a distance, there was an insurmountable difference in skill. The two-headed men with poisoned fangs closed in on the cavalry. After several crossings and collisions, the Thosten cavalry was shattered in formation by a pincer attack.</p>

<p>“So one-sided!”</p>

<p>Among the Highserk Imperial Army, which had lost many of its units after the Battle of the Four Nations Alliance and the Great Outbreak, only the Jaff Cavalry Battalion had fully retained its original form. Its mobility was used to rub the Great Outbreak against Liberitoa, and as a result, it was preserved.</p>

<p>“So that is why Master Gran raided the peninsula by surprise through force.”</p>

<p>The Highserk Imperial Army was the tiger child of the Highserk Imperial Army, which supported the Empire during its expansion. Things are different. If you try to catch them with the arm of infantry, they will run away, and if you turn your back, they will bite off your soft flanks. In fact, the place where the Henuri arrived was already a battlefield. Countless cavalrymen had been killed and their horses lay helpless. If they were reorganized, the number of cavalrymen would probably be more than a dozen. But how could they stop that cavalry battalion with that many cavalrymen?</p>

<p>"The Sarajevo garrison, which was facing each other, is retreating back to the fortress. What about the pursuit?"</p>

<p>One of the knights in the military camp asked Lars about the future.</p>

<p>"Leave it, there is no way we can pursue them. We have to bring Rokkou's forces down to the provisional border line. The siege is broken. It will cascade to the entire front, this is."</p>

<p>Asarina Slope, at the western end of the mountainous outer line, is the last to be saved. The troops at Talmacane Pass were depending on their escape, but even the steepest terrain at Rokkou would be tough to take into account.</p>

<p>The senior knight's face contorted in regret. What a foolish coward he had been, unbecoming of a knight of Reharzen. He could never die. If he died, the command he had seized would dissipate again. Subconsciously, Lars feared death. Therefore, he took a step back from the opponent whom he had to restrain on the premise that he would be exhausted. The Jaff Cavalry Battalion had attacked him while he was consolidating the center by extracting forces from both flanks. They were proud to cling to a minimal position consisting of a horse-proof fence and fill.</p>

<p>The Royal Army of Craist, which had shaken the Duchy of Myard and inflicted devastating damage on the garrisoned Highserk Imperial troops, had completely missed the moment. The victory that slipped from their hands was far away. The dispatched army was crumbling without showing its full potential. The situation was like a crumbling tower standing on the sand mountain of the exiled country of Ferius.</p>

<p>Episode 26</p>

<p>Stale air, like stagnant heavy oil, filled the closed room. Inadequate ventilation accentuated the moldy smell. The room is small, and when the other party to the secret conversation is the knight commander, who is always rough on people, Makoto is not inclined to hide his discomfort.</p>

<p>“So, you're going to go to the trouble of calling me over from the front lines to play some more tricks on me?”</p>

<p>This is not the first time he's been called out like this. It was usually a call to get involved in some nefarious scheme.</p>

<p>"To put it simply. I'm going to kill Ayane."</p>

<p>“...... huh, I don't want to stay here too long, but I could use a little more preamble.”</p>

<p>Exhaling air he doesn't want to breathe, Makoto reveals the emotions he holds. The head of the armed group known as the Knights of Reharzen may have forgotten somewhere about caring, or perhaps he was not born with it, for the most part.</p>

<p>“If it were Youto, this would be enough for you.”</p>

<p>“I hope I'm not in your league.”</p>

<p>What was required was empathy. It was no joke. The man in front of me was not a schoolgirl looking for sympathy for a small talk in a classroom. He is a distorted object, carefully beaten and forged in the forge of the battlefield. There is no such thing as a muscular girl," Makoto spat inwardly.</p>

<p>"There are only two of us from the same hometown. And you, who are not the least bit upset that I'm going to kill your childhood friend, are already from our side of the world."</p>

<p>He had a point, he interjected. It's not that I am unaware of my altered sense of values. If it had been right after he was lured into the other world, Mako had already adapted to this world as he walked across the battlefield.</p>

<p>“Look at this.”</p>

<p>He looks down at the stack of papers thrown out on the desk. A royal wax seal was stamped on a letter made of fine paper. The seal was cut.</p>

<p>"As you can see, both the messenger and the letter have been sent out. Ayane is only to remain in Celta and heal the wounded. If this had been Craist, it would have been a beautiful story. But Myard with Highserk is no joke."</p>

<p>Despite his tone of condemnation, the Knight Commander in front of him does not change a single expression.</p>

<p>“What does that have to do with me?”</p>

<p>For the Kingdom of Craist, this is indeed a grave situation. However, what is in it for Makoto? At the very least, he is doing more than the food, clothing, shelter, and rewards he is given. The knight commander whispers venom to Makoto, who seems uninterested.</p>

<p>“Are you going to give it up to your best friend again?”</p>

<p>It was a clear provocation. Makoto instantly unleashes the magic he's been working on. Expecting Gran to roll over in pain, he quickly kicked the desk with the tip of his shoe. The thick top panel blocks heat and cold. It's a very practical desk, I see. The poor desk, taken as a substitute, is eroded by fire and ice.</p>

<p>"I hope you're careful with your words. I haven't been coasting for the past two years either."</p>

<p>The diligent Knight Commander is involved not only in the armed forces of the Order of Knights, but also in the strength of the newly established corps. His self-discipline may not be as well developed as it used to be. Makoto, on the other hand, has spent two years fighting in various places. Even when it comes to individual combat, their skills are not that far apart.</p>

<p>"It seems so. Sit down."</p>

<p>Gran didn't even smile at the girl's cute prank, but pointed to the chair that had been bounced away with his chin. Leaving the wreckage of the desk that separated them both intact, the chair was raised and Makoto sat back down.</p>

<p>"Ayane is now the pillar of Myard. Even though she had the opportunity to return to Craist. The wobbling pillar must be removed. Makoto, Ayane must be a hindrance to you as well. Shall we go back to being second again?"</p>

<p>“No kidding.”</p>

<p>Baring his canine teeth, Makoto barked.</p>

<p>"Of the three heroes, only Makoto can be a hero, both physically and mentally. Yuto is weak. Ayane doesn't know reality. Don't look at me like that. It is true. If Ayane, the only one of the two from your hometown, is dead, there is only one place to depend on. Or you can give the man of your dreams to a woman who may return home on a whim."</p>

<p>It was a disgusting argument, but not out of line. Makoto had always been Yuto's number two. Makoto was enjoying the bitterness of the bite, when suddenly he had a sense of déjà vu. It was uncomfortable, as if he had a bone stuck in his throat. Shaking his legs and searching his memory, Makoto's doubts are cleared. Ah, well, the way the man in front of him was talking was rooted in the same nosy girl in the classroom.</p>

<p>“You look like a stiff, but you're more of a snob than you think. ...... They say love and war are means to an end, but is it true?”</p>

<p>For the first time in the secret talk, Makoto smiled. The stiff in front of him also seemed to have relaxed somewhat. In the end, Makoto took advantage of the sweet talk. He thought it would be in his best interest to do so.</p>

<p>So, of all people, he's taking Yuto's place?　Ayane has bad taste, too."</p>

<p>From a corner of the mountaintop overlooking the mining town, Makoto observed the progress of the battle. It was understandable until the surprise attack was noticed, but what followed was not good. The Ferius soldiers were no match for the infamous Demon Fire. Even those who avoided a head-on battle were blocked by the guards holed up in the church building and were unable to make their entry. Although they had enough spirit, the difference in strength was obvious. The game was already decided when the battle developed into a cut-and-grind.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to make sure that you have a good idea of what you're getting into. Ah, just a crack ...... n?"</p>

<p>Another one was cut vertically in two, helmet and all, by an axe-spear. It may seem like a wasteful way to kill someone, but it was probably a kind of performance. Who wants to be chopped up like a fish or vegetable. As expected, there was a disjuncture in the line of footing. Makoto, who had been observing from afar, distorted his face at the noise. It was not the accompanying Craist soldiers. According to Gran, it was a locally procured force.</p>

<p>“Uncle, if you make too much noise, they'll find out.”</p>

<p>"Don't be silly!　Are you abandoning us?</p>

<p>“Abandoning us?” The promise we made was to get rid of the healing sorcerers. I don't want to hear from people who can't break into a building because they've been preparing and getting information to launch a surprise attack.</p>

<p>“You puked, little girl!”</p>

<p>The man, his face as red as a boiled octopus, continues to make noise.</p>

<p>"Ah, con, con, di? ...... Oh, Mr. Condillata, you'd better calm down--"</p>

<p>Mako quieted Condilata, who was inwardly cold but still foaming at the mouth, but it was too late. If a sword grows out of a man's belly, most people die. This man was of the majority.</p>

<p>"That's why I told you. I killed them after all."</p>

<p>He looked at his underlings with a look of disgusted reproach, but there was no sign of remorse.</p>

<p>"What good is a lord who has lost his lands and even his private army? Craist gave him weapons, money, and opportunity. And now we have this abomination. What more do you want from us?"</p>

<p>Both Makoto and the Kingdom of Craist promised - well, they didn't make a mistake. They gave their utmost assistance to take back the land they had lost. The result of their risking their lives was the non-fulfillment of the contract.</p>

<p>“Wow, you sound like Commander Gran.”</p>

<p>In place of the busy Commander, a member of the Order accompanied Makoto. The tone of the members, who had received a lot of training from him, was like that of a mini-Gran. It was a big deal that such a thing had proliferated, but this one was still somewhat easier to deal with.</p>

<p>“If I can be compared to the great Knight Commander, then I'm happy.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I guess so.”</p>

<p>After giving a blank reply, Makoto once again turned his attention to the battle situation. At the edge of his vision, the former lord of the Refun area was being thrown into a mine shaft.</p>

<p>"I knew it's no good. So, I'm about to get wiped out."</p>

<p>Without the Lure of the Underworld, he was about to wipe out dozens of them. The remainder could be counted on both hands; it wasn't worth looking any further. Makoto asked the knight in charge of the operation for his judgment.</p>

<p>"It's about time. Get ready."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I'll do it. After all, we're playing in the mud again, aren't we?"</p>

<p>Sinking his arms into the ground, Mako poured magic power into the ground and began to manipulate the soil and water. The heavy rain the other day was enough for a rehearsal that also served as bait.</p>

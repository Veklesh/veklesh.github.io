<p>Episode 44</p>

<p>"Not good. Not good at all."</p>

<p>A man passes in front of the lined-up soldiers with a lament. His features are so long and thin that they can be seen through his armor, and his skin tone is hardly healthy. His armor, which is so ornate that it could be mistaken for ceremonial armor, is so incongruous that it resembles that of a clergyman who is committed to poverty and purity.</p>

<p>In other words, they are like fragile aristocrats and clergymen who know little about conflict. For those who work in the battlefield, they should be loathsome. However, there was no one who could ridicule them if such bright armor was covered with a thick smear of blood that could not be wiped off. In fact, the tension in the air made them hesitant to even swallow a mouthful of blood. It is no wonder. The emblem of the Knights of Reharzen is engraved on his breastplate.</p>

<p>“I'm sure they were so bloodthirsty during the looting along the way.”</p>

<p>It is not just any member of the Order, either. It's a deputy commander, one of the knight's pinnacles, walking around, worried about the state of the war. The Kingdom of Craist's violent apparatus for dealing with internal and external threats, that was the impression that people from other countries had of the Knights of Reharzen. While the former inhabitants of Ferius and even the citizens of Craist are called militia, only the soldiers led by the Knights of Rihazen are called standing soldiers.</p>

<p>In the Kingdom of Craist, only those who have blue blood, a noble birth, and who have endured the selection process of education and training starting from childhood are called knights. The idea of knighthood, which upholds noblesse oblige, was also becoming severely radicalized by ordinary citizens and peasants. Whether or not he knew that the soldiers of the old Felician order were concerned about this, Sylance, deputy commander of the Knights of Reharzen, spoke to the militiamen.</p>

<p>"Your comrades-in-arms and commanders who died on the battlefield were great men. The loss of these comrades-in-arms is lamentable. We have lost so many. It is just heartbreaking. What are you doing about it?"</p>

<p>No one answered, but Sylance could have gone either way.</p>

<p>"You have been slow to put pressure on the cut-through on the grounds of reorganization. What can you do with such reluctance?"</p>

<p>Sylance enumerates the facts to the reduced number of generals.</p>

<p>"We are inviting the enemy's offensive, albeit a limited one. It is nothing but laziness to let them return to the cut-throat at their leisure. It's just a word of sorrow."</p>

<p>But blaming will not make things better. Sylance came to Orsellica to reestablish the offensive. It was his duty to give the generals a helping hand in an easy-to-understand manner.</p>

<p>“However,” he said. Many generals and officers were killed, including Paramusto, the first centurion. The “Demon Fire” users who guarded the cut-throughs were very powerful indeed. Many of our brothers were killed in the Sarajevo fortress. It is no wonder that you are so overwhelmed. I will forgive a single defeat and a reluctant offensive."</p>

<p>Showing his forgiveness, Sylance even showed his appreciation for those who had fought for him. The air is loosened by the relieved soldiers. Then a dry clapping sound echoes. It was the deputy commander's. "But I have one thing on my mind.</p>

<p>"But there is one thing that bothers me. What are these people?　Tell me."</p>

<p>Sylance, who had turned back to a straight face, begged to be told, saying he did not understand. At the end of his pursuing gaze, three soldiers bound behind their backs were sitting down. Their faces were beaten so badly that no one was safe. The only remaining centurion told them who they were.</p>

<p>"They are ...... fugitives. My leadership was not good enough."</p>

<p>"I find it hard to believe. Do you guys have any explanation for what happened?"</p>

<p>Sylance folded his knees and sat down before speaking. The fugitives all rolled up at once.</p>

<p>"I have family back home!</p>

<p>"It was just a momentary lapse of imagination. When I saw the blue flame, my legs started to tremble.</p>

<p>"Please, please. Please have mercy on me."</p>

<p>Sylance, who had listened and fully digested what he had to say, nodded his head several times.</p>

<p>"I see. I understand your point. And now what?　Your comrades-in-arms, your enemies, and I all have at least some family. I'm sure we all feel the same fear of the blue flame. What else?　You have a mission to just abandon your friends and run away, don't you?　Would you tell me about it?"</p>

<p>I did not get the response Sylance was hoping for. Only grunts and words that made no sense came out. Why are people so stupid and weak? Sadness and disappointment filled him inexplicably.</p>

<p>"No way, no?　You just put your personal feelings first and ...... you have shallowly betrayed your troops, your nation, and placed an unreasonable burden on your fellow man. Those who cannot work for the good of the community are no better than demons that must be exterminated."</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no, no!”</p>

<p>"Give me another chance, I can fight!　I can fight!</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. We showed you mercy as a stopgap when you lost your country. There will be no second time. Never. Then get on with it."</p>

<p>At a signal from Cylance, the soldiers assigned to carry out the execution restrain the fugitive and tie a noose around his neck. The end of the knot reached out to a large tree that had lost its branches in the fire and was rotting away like a dead tree.</p>

<p>"Hang him. Slowly and politely, and do not break the neck."</p>

<p>Strangulation from a height was a merciful method of execution. Shattering the cervical vertebrae, taking away consciousness in an instant. Very humane indeed. But for the defeatists before us, it was too extreme. They would have one last job to do before they learned the pleasure of it. Their bodies are gradually lifted upward, and the soles of their shoes leave the ground completely. The flailing feet catch nowhere.</p>

<p>“Oooooooooooooooooooo!!!!”</p>

<p>Bloodshot eyes stared resentfully at the sub-commander. His attitude is admirable as he finally tries to fulfill his task. Without blinking, he responded to the gaze with an erect and unwavering stance. It was unfortunate that his gaze was averted in mid-step. How far a half-wit can you go? Sylance wanted to admire their final service, to tell their story with his eyes.</p>

<p>Cylance counted two hundred breaths until the fugitives' consciousness and life completely vanished. Their bodies, which had been swinging like pendulums, gradually became slower and slower, and the sound of fecal droplets dripping onto the ground echoed through the air. There was nothing else: the scraping rope, the stifled sound of breathing, nothing else. There is only controlled silence.</p>

<p>"It's wonderful. That's what makes us human."</p>

<p>After witnessing the defeatist's end, Sylance turned around. There was a lovable order. The soldiers had been corrected in their all-too-common posture and attitude, and they were attentive to every word, every whisper. Finally, they taught themselves a lesson. In death they served the community.</p>

<p>“Put them down and give them a careful burial.”</p>

<p>Sylance hung on to finish up before the heat had cooled.</p>

<p>"I'm not going to order you to just die. I will be with you. And Commander Gran has taken every precaution with the imperial knights. I promise you proper reinforcements."</p>

<p>The soldiers had shown. With respect and determination, Sylance must respond. With every fiber of their being, down to the last shred of their lives. This is noblesse oblige, the mission of those who stand above others.</p>

<p>“So, gentlemen, let us wage war once again.”</p>

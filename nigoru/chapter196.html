<p>Episode 42</p>

<p>A wild, high-pitched cry that could not have been squeezed out of a human throat roars through the cut-throat. The cacophony of agony played by the people was the product of a single imperial knight. In the fiery crucible of the fire, Walm watched for the whereabouts of the burnt ones. A second skin, a magical membrane that can protect against magical exposure and even melee weapons, it is even tough enough to withstand Demon Fire, depending on the individual. Those with a certain level of skill and determination would cross the sea of blue flames and turn their blades against the imperial knights.</p>

<p>The army surging before them is composed of a large number of replaceable infantrymen. Even so, if the skilled soldiers and strongmen among them could be extracted, the elimination of the imperial knights might have been achieved. However, the strength of the intentional mixture of stones and stones and the group had turned into weakness in the face of the blue flames that burned themselves.</p>

<p>“The fire won't go out, yo!”</p>

<p>“うっ、ぁあ゛っ――”</p>

<p>Reflexively, the soldiers danced around to get rid of the fire. Some fell to the ground to escape the flames, but the out-of-control group did not care for their footing. Waiting for him were the soles of countless shoes, and the muffled decimations heralded a crushing death.</p>

<p>“Get back, ah, get back, ah, get back!”</p>

<p>“Don't push me, ah--stop, let go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>Once melted, the candle burns fiercely and does not stop. Even the old strongmen, who would normally be protected by a solid magical membrane, are engulfed by the human wave and the heat wave. How many people can keep their composure when they are being stirred up from the front, back, left, and right by the external force of both sides and the group that is bursting into flames one after the other?</p>

<p>Those who tried to climb up the earthen mound were grabbed by the shoulders and fell into the inner law. It is an unbelievably bad move to obstruct a retreating friend. But the drowning man clutches at straws. Both the one who grabbed and the one who was grabbed just wanted to escape from the blue flame. A figure jumped out from the crowd that had turned into such a screaming scene. It was aiming for the imperial knight, the exact opposite of the direction from which the majority of people were waiting and evading.</p>

<p>“There is no other way out but to cut off the Demon Fire users!”</p>

<p>Even under these circumstances, there are a few who are trying to seize control of the personnel and cut off the source of the fire. It was the enemy commander who was in command when they crossed the cut-through. He bellowed that the limited evacuation route would not allow the entire unit to retreat. The thin film of magical power was shaken erratically by the Demon Fire, and his clothes and skin were scorched. He is a man of great character, whether it is pride or duty that supports him.</p>

<p>“Follow the Palamusto centurion!”</p>

<p>The non-commissioned officers who responded to his call seized the half-crazed soldiers, and they came together in a mass that could hardly be called a formation. For the soldiers, the enlisted men are enough to cling to on the battlefield. If this had been a field battle, he would have been amused by their death struggle. But it was not to be. This was Myard's carefully prepared position, a kill zone. Walm was only one element to compensate for the feigned defeat of the unskilled paratroopers' company.</p>

<p>“Misfire, give me a break.”</p>

<p>A siren-like wind noise rattled Walm's eardrums.</p>

<p>“Ugh, yeah, yeah.”</p>

<p>One of the soldiers following him bent his body into a crouch, accompanied by a muffled scream. Several magic spells cut through the swirling blue flames. They were claymore bullets. As arranged in advance, Deborah's magic soldiers and throwers began to cover the area from a special fire point called a curved ring. The earth bullets, which had been kneaded and hardened, crushed their arms and legs along with their armor, and countless projectiles rained down on them. As one by one they fell, the commander, called Paramusto, shouted.</p>

<p>“And, oh, no!”</p>

<p>His chestplate is distorted by the stones, and his left arm hangs limp. His skin is already burned reddish-black. But he still does not stop. Even though there were no more soldiers behind him, Walm glared through his Demon Mask at his closest enemy, and he swung his axe spear carelessly and cleaved him.</p>

<p>The axe head entered through the shoulder opening, slashed through the armor, and passed through the hip bone. The palamusto, slashed in an overthrow, fell to the ground slumped on its face. A longsword is thrown down from his scorched fingers and strikes the imperial knight's half boot. It was Walm who cut him down and cruelly sent his men to their deaths. The emotions held are no comfort to the dead. It may even be an insult. Still, he could not help but tell them.</p>

<p>“Surely, it has arrived.”</p>

<p>He lifts his face, which had been face down to witness the death. The militiamen who failed to escape threw themselves not only from the earthworks but also from the cliffs and cut banks. Depending on where they landed, it was tantamount to throwing themselves overboard, but some may have survived. Those who cut into the imperial knights were not entirely in vain. Originally, they had intended to spread further confusion at the mound.</p>

<p>“...... sorry.”</p>

<p>Walm uttered his penance. It was not for the dead in front of him, but for the tragedy to come. Those who made it past the mounds were probably appeasing their hearts, which were on the verge of bursting with tension and confusion. They may have finally come to their senses after escaping from the dead, and may be helping their friends out of a sense of guilt. The voice trying to regroup from behind the mound is a surviving officer who has correctly recognized the sense of danger.</p>

<p>The swirling blue flames are rapidly fading. The stagnant air, the sobbing smell of burning people and heaving heat lingered on the plain. The only thing left in clear view was a bonfire of what used to be human beings. There were no survivors. And yet, it was not the end. It is not the end. Once the enemy was hurt, and the whole place had collapsed, there was only one thing to do. A powerful voice echoed like a mountain wind in the night.</p>

<p>"All hands, charge!　If you cut corners today, you will regret it tomorrow!</p>

<p>These were words that hit the essence of the matter. The head instructor understood it well. The attack drums echoed to color the order for the assault. Walm jumped over the earth mound of wreckage in advance of the earth-shaking assault.</p>

<p>“Come on, get up, get up!”</p>

<p>“They're coming, the Myard soldiers are coming!”</p>

<p>"Take up arms, don't run away. Don't run away. The mounds will prevent them from pursuing you!</p>

<p>Soldiers grunted, burned alive by the cut-throat's outer law, by the sidewalks and in the shade of the trees. What they all have in common is fear and frustration. Walm, having finished his inventory, pushes them back. The target is the officer who is the calming agent of the group. Ignoring the soldiers in line, he closes the gap between them.</p>

<p>"Whoa, ah!</p>

<p>"It's the Demon Fire user!</p>

<p>“Don't be frightened, take them out!”</p>

<p>The more painfully burned they were, the more they crawled to avoid it. Still, there were soldiers who bravely stood their ground.</p>

<p>"My arm!</p>

<p>“How can I stop that thing?”</p>

<p>Walm used his axe and spear to deliver a powerful blow to the limbs and neck. If you only think about efficiency, it's a big swing and useless. However, there is no better place for a blow that twists reason and demonstrates. After cutting down four people, a natural path was made.</p>

<p>“You're a centurion, aren't you?”</p>

<p>The only surviving centurion answers the imperial knight's question with a drawn sword.</p>

<p>“Damn you, if you're coming, come on!”</p>

<p>The sword body of the two swordsmen are lit up with magic power. He must know how to use his sword. Perhaps he is a former soldier. The longsword is raised against the raised axe spear. After a moment's struggle, the tip of the sword points in the wrong direction with the elbow.</p>

<p>The man tries to prevent this by closing the gap between the two swords. His movements were smooth and he was accustomed to actual combat. In fact, the centurion's shoulder landed on Walm's chest, just as he had intended. While countless soldiers watched with bated breath, the centurion's posture wavered without making his next move. Warmth tickles Walm's skin. The hot liquid was fresh blood spurting from his neck. Like a dry desert, the Demon Mask drinks up the blood as it pours down.</p>

<p>“You monster!”</p>

<p>The Hyakuninchou mutters accusingly at the sight of the masks soaking up the living blood, and his eyes rapidly lose their life. His feeble arms could not grasp anything, and he crumpled to Walm's feet. The axe spear he thrust out as he dived, the branch blade that ripped through his throat, took on a bloody sheen. The bodies of the Craist militiamen were as heavy as lead, even though they had an enemy to kill. They were unable to speak, but they were finally brought back to themselves by an army that had crossed the ridge called a cut-through.</p>

<p>"The enemy is coming!</p>

<p>Those who shouted and those who raised their weapons found the tips of their ears covered in sticky blood. Without much effort, Walm buried them, burning away the group's sense of defiance.</p>

<p>"Charge!</p>

<p>Push them to the bottom!"</p>

<p>In the company of drill soldiers, the head instructor, Yorgim and Moyes, holding the reins, move the limbs of the men. The new recruits descending the slope wield spears and swords at random. Walm explained the situation to them.</p>

<p>"Don't hit your armor in the dark!　You'll chip the blade and just miss!　Aim at their flanks or legs, and they will stop moving."</p>

<p>Having only been out of combat virginity for a few days, they were poorly trained and ignorant of battlefield etiquette. A small poke to the back of an opponent who is running away at full speed will not stop him. They will aim for the fatal flanks or the legs that support their escape. The neck, which is small in area and difficult to aim at, was not suitable for beginners.</p>

<p>As if to set an example, a Craist militiaman would fall to his knees when a branch blade was used to sharpen the lower limbs of a soldier descending a slope. When the man lunged for his hands to get up, countless blades were waiting for him. He was beaten to a pulp by new soldiers who knew nothing of addition and subtraction - over and over again. And so the second fall was eternal.</p>

<p>"...... you're already dead. Don't hit dead bodies all the time."</p>

<p>I didn't want to be shriveled up like a puppy, but blood intoxication was also a thought. After a series of minor mistakes and trial and error, the sprouts, supported by handholding, followed Walm's teachings and went after them. The gap between themselves and the rest of the army was huge. There was no time to add any more effort. Even though they had the upper hand locally, Myard and Highserk were being driven back on the entire board.</p>

<p>The pursuing soldiers are rolling down the hill with their friends in their wake. There is no one anywhere to correct their disorder and hold them back. The blood overflowing on the hill of Orsellica turns into a river and flows down the slope. Countless dead are contained within.</p>

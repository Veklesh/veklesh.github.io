<p>Episode 54</p>

<p>Wispy, half-broken pillars block people like inverted bushes. Houses that once supported people's livelihoods are now entangled and crushed together to form an ugly barrier. The town, now in ruins and covered in rubble and dust, ironically showed a liveliness and enthusiasm not seen in peacetime. Blood mist drifts through the void with the flames of the explosion, and the main street is dyed reddish-black after the clash of iron against iron.</p>

<p>“Ooooh, ooooh, gosh!”</p>

<p>A Craist soldier who had just climbed over the rubble shouted to inspire himself, but was silenced in a daze by a flying arrow. His comrades also had spears inserted under their jaws, and they all became part of the barrier as an ugly obstacle.</p>

<p>“Don't swing so big, you idiot!”</p>

<p>“Stick it back small!”</p>

<p>Side streets and back alleys, which retain their original form in comparison to the main road, are no exception. After trying to hit each other's flanks, they meet on the narrow streets and engage in a thrusting attack. While they were relieved to get through, what awaited them was the attack magic of the Highserk soldiers, and the projectiles in the closed area created a chain of further house collapses.</p>

<p>“Ugh, geez!”</p>

<p>Get back, get back, it's going to collapse!</p>

<p>Oh, oh, oh, oh!</p>

<p>In the midst of such a battle, another Highserk soldier was scattered before the eyes of Friug, who was in command. The cross-section of the soldier, who had been slashed to death with his armor, was smooth, as if he did not know the reason of the world.</p>

<p>The one who stroked and slashed his subordinate was a knight of Reharzen called Liard. The blow from his “hard blow,” which was imbued with magic power, cut through iron as well. At the knight's feet, a pile of wreckage, more than one hand could hold, was piled up. The Kingdom of Craist's army was divided in the center of the town, but the leading group, led by the knight, was showing tenacity.</p>

<p>"Don't be cowardly, go over the rubble and keep pushing!</p>

<p>Despite the wounds on their bodies, their magical film and energy had not diminished in the slightest. Riard continues to prove himself a brave general, as he is entrusted with the task of leading the advance troops. Troops naturally flock to a brave commander. If a large number of them were present, a breakthrough could even be made. They had to be crushed before the subsequent influx of troops. The enemy, however, followed the same line of thought as Friug. It was a headhunt.</p>

<p>“Die!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>Friug struck the spear that was brought out with a curse with the spine of his sword and deflected it to his feet. It was a solid thrust, but not everything can be done with all your might. It was important to know where to take your hands off. The Craist soldier, who had been running, leaned forward as if he were falling, and exposed his neck unprotected.</p>

<p>Friug raised his sword carelessly. After a slight resistance, the dull blade slashed at his throat, leaving a trail of blood in the sky. He was aware of his own lack of discipline, but his gaze had already turned to his next opponent without witnessing the end of those who lay on the ground. Learning a lesson from the death of his comrades, the Craist soldiers stopped and waited. Friug, as he was invited to do, swung his sword without a care. The soldier, who had been expecting a slash, caught Friug's flash in the upper part of his body after a struggle.</p>

<p>“Ugh!”</p>

<p>Sticking to the basics is not bad, but when the sword that prevented it has plenty of living blood, it's a different story. The warm, raw blood poured down onto his face, forcing him to blink for a moment. Friug stepped in, his upper body sinking. He does not possess the agility of a wind magic bearer. Still, to this soldier, it would appear as if he had vanished from sight for a moment.</p>

<p>His twin eyes caught the figure, but it was too late. The blade cut the back of the knee, and about a third of the blade bit into the back of the knee. The joint is shattered, along with the ligaments, and the soldier's posture wavers as if drowned in alcohol.</p>

<p>“Ahh, ah, ah, ah, ah!”</p>

<p>Friug rushed forward, using the momentum of his step as a starting point for his shoulder. An agonized sword scraped his back, but it was no different than a gentle knock through his armor.</p>

<p>“Damn you--gagh!”</p>

<p>Friug tried to stop the soldier, who was struggling to get up somehow, but there was no need. An axe from the side of his head smashed into his head. Whether he lived or died is needless to say. A sticky liquid trickles down from the axe, the murder weapon. His subordinate officers took care of it as if they were chopping wood. Even without words, the look in their eyes was enough to convey their gratitude. Such was the nature of the battlefield.</p>

<p>Friug and the Craist knights were engaged in a competition, but the division of the line created a large gap in processing capacity. The rapid expansion of the military organization even in the shortest of times led to a serious shortage of junior officers. The few squires they had with them were not enough to control them in a mixed battle.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, oh, no!　Such a death in battle!"</p>

<p>“Cut them down, don't fight with them!”</p>

<p>The opponent was a knight of Reharzen who wielded a powerful blow. Friug crosses his swords, shaking the balance between the outcome of the battle and the damage. The Highserk soldiers, who know what they are doing, follow their commander's lead. They fought as if they were a school of carnivorous fish, picking off their prey bit by bit.</p>

<p>“At least you!”</p>

<p>The grinding frustration is at the same time a result of overconcentration. Not missing Friug's slightest step, Liard and his followers made a last ditch effort. They pried open the bed of spears with their swords, slid their unworkable blades through armor and blood, and twisted themselves out of the encirclement.</p>

<p>“Repel it!”</p>

<p>“No, it's going to pull out!”</p>

<p>It was an act of diving into the thorns, but the momentum never stopped, despite the dripping fresh blood. Friug calmly thrusts out his sword. The dead soldier is afraid. Highserk soldiers, who are used to exchanging lives, understand it well.</p>

<p>"I got your head!</p>

<p>A shimmering blade of magical power approaches Friug. It was a brilliant blow, a life-threatening blow. The axe-head interrupted the pause between the tips of the swords touching each other. The axe, raised in the uppermost position, smashed through Liard's collarbone and reached his heart, sending the knight into the netherworld without even leaving a word at the moment.</p>

<p>"Oh, Liard-sama!</p>

<p>“Damn it!”</p>

<p>Literally, the squires followed their master. It was Saura, the oldest of the underlings, who dealt the fatal blow to his flesh-and-blood prey. It was indeed a modest thing for him to stay one step behind Friug until the latter was in danger, hiding himself and his axe behind his company commander's back. When he looked at her reproachfully, Saura made a flippant statement.</p>

<p>"If the company commander were in the opposite position, he would go after the commander. And that careless step, it's like he said he's going to invite you from now on."</p>

<p>Fishing out of the body as bait. It was also aggravating that he was not generally wrong. Friug, who had stopped talking, followed the deceased knight's orders and continued to cut down those who climbed over the rubble. When the ground could not catch the overflowing blood and a puddle of gut-mixed water formed, the enemies retreated as if they had regained their senses.</p>

<p>“Quicksilver, you've woken up.”</p>

<p>There is no elation of victory, only a feeling of fatigue that clings to you. Wiping my forehead with my sleeve, sweat and blood mingled with the drifting dust. It was a war makeup called sludge. No one raised a battle cry. Myard's men stood dumbfounded or sat down as if they had run out of breath. The company members, on the other hand, were busy greeting the dead by stabbing them to see if those lying at their feet were really dead.</p>

<p>“Myard soldiers, collect your spears and shields from the dead.”</p>

<p>The bodies piled high in a vortex provide the Myard soldiers, who were completely naked, with ample armaments. Friug looked around and saw that in the entire inn town, the enemy had lost five hundred men, instead of two hundred of their own men. This was the end result of their refusal to give in and kill each other. Compared to the number of dead, the number of wounded was extremely small. Those who were unable to move were first exposed to violence. And carefully.</p>

<p>Fatigue was still in their bodies, but they had no time to catch their breath. Soon, the main body of Craist's army would fill the road. The onslaught would continue until they broke through the inn towns.</p>

<p>“Those who have no time to spare, pile up corpses and debris on the defensive wall.”</p>

<p>A bulwark is in poor taste. Friug pointed a finger at it, which would have been more appropriate for a common cemetery.</p>

<p>"Don't make a distinction between the dead and the debris. When I die, pile them up the same way."</p>

<p>Whether hit by the air or not, or whether they don't have the energy to turn their extra thoughts, the Myard soldiers silently follow their work. The only exception was Saura.</p>

<p>"Yes. When the time comes, of course, I will load them without exception."</p>

<p>“Pfft, you infuriating bastard.”</p>

<p>Saura and Friug had shared the battlefield for a long time, including at Dandurg Castle, but he was still a reliable and irritating subordinate. Not long after that, Friug heard a strange noise. It was the sound of metal clattering and scraping against metal, and it was the sound of armor. More than 1,000 people running in unison produced a tremor like the shaking of the earth. The brick fragments and plaster piled up on the protective walls crumbled and shook. It was as if they were laughing.</p>

<p>“They're already here?”</p>

<p>“Haha, twice as many as before.”</p>

<p>A soldier who had been watching from a beam or the wreckage of an armored door let out a dry laugh. Friug tried to calmly assess the total number of the enemy, but was interrupted by the dead lying on the defensive wall. They were fresh dead people who had not yet turned undead. His empty eyes reflected nothing. Even so, I could only feel that he was looking at the living with resentment. Friug, no longer counting, tells the dead.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, many more are going that way. Including me."</p>

<p>Friug's monologue was drowned out by the battle cry.</p>

<p>Episode 62 Tombstone</p>

<p>Two flashing lights burst apart as if they were parting. Particles of magic power that had been stripped from the sword's body scattered, turning into countless sparks that scorched the ground. The heat and pain generated through the magical membrane that can withstand even Demon Fire. This was the result of the fusion of the magic power of the imperial knights and the three heroes. The mixture of lighting and incendiary effect was like white phosphorus. If a single person had been able to manipulate Demon Fire and Holy Strike, it would have been a skill that should also be called White Phosphorus.</p>

<p>“Haaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>

<p>With a yell, Dougo closes in. The stripped-down magic power is clothed in the sword, and they clash again. Walm, not wanting a contest like before, changes the angle of the sword spine that is rubbing against each other and aims at the hand. It would have been good if he could have wounded his wrist or fingers, and even better if he could have guided his consciousness, but the blade was pushed back by the tsubasa.</p>

<p>“Tsk!”</p>

<p>The blade was pushed back. Walm pulled back half his body to create the illusion of distance. A sharp wind noise and a devastating light passed in front of him. The young man flew backward without hesitation, betraying his expectations of whether his next move would be a step or a halting slash. There is not even a pull-off strike. He clings to his hometown like a shadow. He flicked a slash up and down and swung his gaze around, but both blows were struck away.</p>

<p>“What's the matter, are you relying on the ”holy strike“?”</p>

<p>"You're the one who didn't catch it with your sword. You must be out of gas!</p>

<p>The Imperial Knights' magical power was beginning to bottom out due to the continuous battles and Demon Fire that had continued from Orsellica Hill. They probably did not overlook the movement that they did not want to compete aggressively for the magical power. The intention of both sides was simple: the imperial knights were oriented toward short-term battles, and the three heroes were oriented toward endurance battles. If it was a simple matter of skill, Walm was superior. This young man did not have the persistence and skill, cultivated through extensive basic training, of the old general who had been defeated in a cut-throat battle. However, in terms of overall strength, Youto is superior to Ratu.</p>

<p>He compensates for his inferior skills with his enormous amount of magical power and output as a prop, and he uses his magical sword to cover up his failures. The basics of not being swayed are the result of Reharzen's education for gifted students. The immature mentality that should be taken advantage of is more stable now that there are no friends to rely on or to save. It was an ironic story.</p>

<p>If you focus only on the exhaustion of the light sword and checks and balances, you will open up the distance for a “holy strike”. Walm took a step forward to follow, but Yuto's lowered foot dug deeply into the ground. The Wolm's backward step was replaced by an upward strike from the knight of Reharzen.</p>

<p>Stopping abruptly, Walm raised the belly of his sword to catch it. If he deflects it halfway, his shoulder could be shaved off. The sparks that scatter above each other's heads shimmer like meteors and fall to the earth. Demon Masks shudder in delight, and Imperial Knights curse at the pain transmitted through their magical membranes.</p>

<p>“You little shit!”</p>

<p>"Don't act like a senior!</p>

<p>“You're always howling, aren't you?”</p>

<p>He re-fills the unsteadily wavering flaming sword with magic power. Without a pause, Walm attacked. The tip that slipped through the defense scraped the magic membrane, and the strike from the upper level carved a wound across the breastplate. The tips of the knives did not give up their places and pushed each other away. The imperial knight twisted his body into the open space. The shoulder with the aid of the three knights' chests reduces into the chest of the three knights.</p>

<p>“Ugh, ugh!”</p>

<p>Youto's body shakes backward as the impact expels the air from his lungs' entrails. The imperial knight thrusts out a fist, index and middle fingers sticking out and hardening. A jab, using mainly his elbows instead of his hips, extended to his eye socket. Yout bowed his head as if bowing and caught the eye-blow with his forehead.</p>

<p>Walm immediately lifted his half boot and tried to crush the back of his foot with it. Before he could be stitched to the ground, Yout brushed off the imperial knight's breastplate with his weighted elbow. The misplaced sole of his shoe only ended up stomping on the ground. It was a precise counterattack. The imperial knight had learned it in the melee, but the three heroes must have trained in kumite with their armored opponents. He is a serious guy no matter where he goes.</p>

<p>“Ha, you look like you're having a hard time.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, can't you fight?”</p>

<p>Youto exhaled roughly and his face was distorted in pain. From the side, the imperial knights have the upper hand in the battle. But the reality is terrible. As if they were swimming in heavy oil, the weight of exhaustion was weighing down on their entire bodies. The weariness from the lack of magic power is like forcing a dry rag to be wrung out. The leeway they showed was a false pretense to hide their inferiority. The magic power of the flaming sword writhes like a candle that is about to go out.</p>

<p>"You're talking big. You're the one whose magical membrane is shaking."</p>

<p>The young man from his hometown realizes his superiority and gives a small chuckle. It was similar to the frivolous words that the imperial knight had deliberately spat out in battle. It must have affected the impressionable young man. I can only laugh at the fact that I can't even be a role model.</p>

<p>"In a world like this, if you keep on killing each other, you will get tired, won't you?</p>

<p>“How can you say that after killing so many people?”</p>

<p>I knew he would resent it. Ayane used to tell me stories about the old days. Among them, her childhood friend, who was feted as one of the three greats, often came up. Yout is a disciplined person. Whether it is for good or ill, he responds in equal measure.</p>

<p>"You, too, are the same. Hey, Youto."</p>

<p>The tips of the blades rub together, momentarily repelling light and flame. In the midst of such a battlefield, Walm declares in a friendly manner, “I'm not going to let you get away with this,” he says.</p>

<p>"What do you know about me?</p>

<p>His eyes were full of murderous intent, as if he was about to shoot out. I guess so. Locals cannot understand the mindset of a person who has drifted from a distant place, even a different world, and is engaged in an endless war. Unless they are from the same country.</p>

<p>“...... I know what it's like.”</p>

<p>There is a simmering hatred. Many Highserk were killed and murdered. Men who were under my command, men I would call my comrades-in-arms, are dead. As the Walm of Highserk, I have to deal with them. That is why I hesitated to utter the curse. He is trying to use Ayane's precious memories. He is trying to trample on the heart of his countryman who can understand his suffering. Military reason whispers to him. What are you hesitating to do now, fulfill your role?</p>

<p>“I can't go along with this.”</p>

<p>“You lived in 00 prefecture?”</p>

<p>Yuto tried to step out to shake off his evil thoughts, but stopped like a rusty tin doll.</p>

<p>"What is ......?　What, what, damn it, did you get that out of Ayane?"</p>

<p>“You lived near Hachifuchi station, I used to use it every morning on my way to work.”</p>

<p>"No way!　You can't possibly be Japanese!"</p>

<p>Despite the anger in his voice, there was a hint of agitation in his tone. The blood of the knight's body was stained all over, and it was an undeniable fact that the imperial knights had done a number of atrocities up to this point. In Yuto's eyes, the man in front of him is an enemy that must be defeated. However, I cannot help but feel a sense of nostalgia at every word that comes out of his mouth. It is a wonder where I am from. Even if you try to hide it from your hometown friends, they will be aware of it. If it was intentional, the effect was enormous.</p>

<p>"The entrance to the station was narrowed due to earthquake-proofing work, and it was a lot of trouble, wasn't it? And the ticket gates were often broken, so we had to run up the stairs desperately."</p>

<p>The stories told were idle complaints. It is a topic that can only be understood by those who have lived in peace. They talk about peace, but here it turns into a fearless curse.</p>

<p>“What do you want, what do you want, just because you're about to lose?”</p>

<p>"Don't say that. I just want to talk about my hometown with my hometown once in a while."</p>

<p>There was no denial of hometown. There was only the rejection of the stabbing. He quickly switched his posture from leaning to the left to the right, and with a whisper, he aimed at the gap in the armor. Yuto turned on his dominant leg and repelled a slash aimed at his side.</p>

<p>“Stop, I don't want to hear it!!!!”</p>

<p>Flames fizzle out with hot air from the sword blade that caught the light sword's cleave. The wreckage of the weapons and armor that received the aftermath shook. It was like a tombstone. Walm showed no sign of agitation and continued chatting with his sword.</p>

<p>"Is the arcade in front of the station still there? When I was alive, it was deserted and about to go under."</p>

<p>The agility raised by magic power was lost. With experience and skill alone, he dodged the light sword with a single paper stroke, and then, with a crawling posture, he reeled the sword to his knees. The foot he was stepping out of the way was dodged with a nimble step. Yuto's body is still agile.</p>

<p>“I told you to stop!”</p>

<p>"Speaking of which, what happened to the new convenience store products? Was it melon chocolate or caramel cream buns that you last ate?"</p>

<p>The sword is lifted above his head after receiving a thrust from the light sword. It's a great destructive force. The hand gripping the hilt goes numb and loses its grip. With a body devoid of magical power, the odds of winning head-on are slim.</p>

<p>“Damn, damn, damn, shut up, shut up!”</p>

<p>Half panicked, his movements were undisturbed. It was probably the result of repeated training. Youto chased hard after the imperial knight who had taken a step back. The sword caught a sideways cleave dispatch and bounced off into the void. Walm held out his hands and smiled.</p>

<p>“You really look like shit, don't you?”</p>

<p>“Aaaaarrrrggghhhh!”</p>

<p>With a face as crumpled as a rolled up scrap of paper, Youto swung his sword from the top. There is nothing wrong with that habit, nothing wrong with that movement. Is it the effect of adaptation to this world that his mind and body do not match? Walm, too, cannot tame the young man. Despite his friendly mouth, his body moves to vanquish his enemies. The one he kicked up with the sole of his shoe was a sword. It was a mass-produced number strike, but it was familiar to the imperial knight. It belonged to Friug, his former subordinate and comrade-in-arms. Pulling out one of the tombstones stuck in the earth, Walm swung it carelessly.</p>

<p>“Ugh, ugh!!!!”</p>

<p>It split Youto's left wrist, just as he was about to strike down. The sword that did not reach him was passed on to the imperial knight along with his indomitable will.</p>

<p>“You even threw away your sword, finally.”</p>

<p>He wounded and plunged a young man in the same situation, both physically and mentally. It would be more vicious than just killing him. With his one remaining hand, he swings his light sword and strikes his countryman's right knee with it as he tries to escape. Through the kneepad, he felt a dull, bone-crushing response. Aiming to stop him, he swung the sword down at his neck, but a flash of light repelled the slash. Yuto, who had stopped completely, raised the light sword in an intimidating manner and let out a hot breath.</p>

<p>The magic sword, which could kill him instantly depending on where it touched, was still alive and well. Walm was searching for a way to attack Yuto, who was unable to move. They stopped slashing at each other for the first time.</p>

<p>“Hmph, hmph, gghh, you're confusing me, after all...”</p>

<p>The adult who is supposed to guide the young man with an understanding of his circumstances misled him with his eighty-two words. There is no room for excuses.</p>

<p>“To be honest, I was going to kill you with that blow I gave you.”</p>

<p>"Don't be silly. I'm still going to kill you."</p>

<p>“Oh, I'll kill you with ease, just shut your eyes.”</p>

<p>I'm not kidding. You're the one who's tired, aren't you? I'm going to put you to sleep.</p>

<p>You can't just take the head off. He would aim for one of the two remaining limbs. He swung from side to side, changing his response depending on the situation. His military mind immediately decided on his next move. It was at that very moment that he was about to make his move.</p>

<p>"...... arcade is still there. The last I saw, the clerk was asleep at the counter. The station construction is still going on, too, and that ticket gate is still pipping and broken."</p>

<p>“Ugh, ggh.”</p>

<p>These were the words he used after reading the signs of an attack. This young man is irrepressibly disciplined. If you throw a word at him, he'll really respond with the same amount of words.</p>

<p>"That really works, doesn't it? You look terrible."</p>

<p>It's a deadly poison that eats away at the mind. It was Walm's turn to have his thoughts disturbed. The murderous intent, hostility, and hatred he had harbored were stirred up, and all that came to mind were feelings of melancholy and nostalgia. The imperial knight cleaved the ground in frustration.</p>

<p>"You little shit, I'm out of control. I can't think straight. I want to kill you, but I don't want to."</p>

<p>“I'm going to turn you back exactly like that.”</p>

<p>Once again, Walm looked at the young man's face. It felt like he had seen a student like this on his gloomy commute to work. It was an everyday scene. I couldn't remember everything. He let out a sigh of resignation.</p>

<p>"Hahhhh Yout ...... surrender. I won't make it worse."</p>

<p>"You want me to trust the imperial knights? You killed a lot of people."</p>

<p>"Don't let Ayane tell you that I killed my hometown, my childhood friend. This is the last time. Drop the sword."</p>

<p>Walm said with a murderous intent. Refuse, and I will kill you. It was a one-sided ultimatum. He and Youto glared at each other through the gap in their upper stance. I don't know who was the first to break the antagonism. They found themselves relaxing their hostility toward each other.</p>

<p>"...... I get it. But tell me about you. I don't know anything yet."</p>

<p>Youto's response to Walm's words of compromise was puzzlement.</p>

<p>“Uh-oh.”</p>

<p>As Yout was about to lower his sword, something rushed in from behind him. Walm could not warn him. If someone who was supposed to be dead appeared, his throat would dry up. The imperial knight's dismay was palpable to his countrymen.</p>

<p>“A splice, Duwei!!!!”</p>

<p>Hostility filled Togo's eyes again. The raised light sword pushed back the battleaxe, which was shimmering with magic power, once. But there was no second time. The axe head pushes in the spine of the sword and cuts it off from the right collarbone to the left hip bone with a single swing.</p>

<p>“Ah, ah, ah!”</p>

<p>It was an unrealistic scene, as if we were watching a badly made movie. The imperial knight, who had almost forgotten how to breathe, managed to squeeze out a few words. His former comrades, with whom he had shared many hardships, had killed his countrymen.</p>

<p>“Duwei, what are you doing ......?”</p>

<p>"I just killed an enemy, an avenger. I just killed my enemy, my avenger, the one who had squashed my squad like a maggot. They took out Captain Liguria, too."</p>

<p>"Yeah, but they didn't. Oh, shit, why ...... yout ......"</p>

<p>No need to probe. It was a mortal wound. Even if it was a curse, I was responsible for hearing the words at this moment. I thought I had tightened my heart and prepared myself, but even that was not enough.</p>

<p>"A, yane, makto, koto, ah, ah, ah, I want to go back. I want to go back."</p>

<p>The words she spun were her feelings for her childhood friend and her former hometown. What should I say to her? There was no way I could hold her hand. All Walm could do was look down at her in silence. Life poured out of the wounds that crossed his body. Light was lost.</p>

<p>"It's useless. It's already dead."</p>

<p>Duwei said in a tone that told him it was a chore. It was impossible to unravel the confused thoughts. It was the worst aftertaste. Walm's voice trailed off, his face grimacing with bitterness and sourness.</p>

<p>“You, squad leader,” he said.</p>

<p>"Kill the enemy. I taught you that the first time we met."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, I've killed plenty of enemies!　But you weren't the kind of guy who would kill for nothing."</p>

<p>I knew the answer. A body full of splintered pieces, murky eyes. The skin of different colors, like a jigsaw puzzle, was somehow familiar. What had his former superiors seen and lost in their dying homeland? No need to ask.</p>

<p>"You always had a sweet tooth, but not in battle. Walm, you've changed. ...... Well, rest there. I have the rest to take care of."</p>

<p>The squad leader left the battlefield ruins, leaving behind the dead bodies of his countrymen and the imperial knights. Walm sat down on the ground, exhausted. He carelessly took off his chain helmet and removed his Demon Mask. The hot air cools as it comes into contact with the open air. The air, which had been so hot, was now impossibly cold.</p>

<p>“You've changed, haven't you?”</p>

<p>Walm's voice did not reach Duwei. In the distance, screams and angry shouts still echoed. But the directionality of the sound had changed from inside to outside. I didn't want to think about the meaning of that now. No words of redemption, no tears. Such a cheap substitute would not be sought by the unsuspecting hometown. I just stared at what had been a yout in lethargy.</p>

<p>Only the Demon Mask that sipped the offered sacrifice was laughing at the tombstone with its keta-keta-keta. It seemed to be enjoying itself.</p>

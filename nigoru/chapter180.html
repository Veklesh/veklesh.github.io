<p>Episode 27</p>

<p>The hot breath tickles the skin, and the armor shakes in response to the lungs' hunger for oxygen. Walm moves only his eyes over the mask, searching for movement in his vision. The only sound in the bustling area is the sound of his own breathing. Anyone approaching the church hall had equally vanished.</p>

<p>“Huh, haha--”</p>

<p>A stench, along with steam, was coming from the red-carpeted ground. The distant gaze of the people in the distance is all residents of the mining town. But we can't let our guard down. After all, this was an attack by former Ferius soldiers who were supposed to have brought the area under their control. Even the seemingly harmless citizens of the town are feared to be hostile.</p>

<p>“Justan, can you hear me?”</p>

<p>Walm looks down as he calls out into the building. The dead assailant, clutching a large mallet, sticks to the door, unmoved. The way he was sitting there, he even looked like a gatekeeper. Even though it was a melee, he remembered at least who he had killed. The unfamiliar corpse must have struck back through the gap in the door that was being smashed down.</p>

<p>"I can hear you. It looks like it's over out there."</p>

<p>The answer was immediate. Just as Walm probed the room, Justan looked outside.</p>

<p>“As far as I can see - there's probably some missing.”</p>

<p>There is a big gap between being prepared to be wiped out and being wiped out. There must have been some soldiers who realized their defeat and ran away.</p>

<p>“It's not like Highserk to have leftovers.”</p>

<p>A derisive remark about the nature of the empire. Walm replied sarcastically.</p>

<p>"You think you're a mother?　More importantly, what's the damage over there?"</p>

<p>“One was stabbed in the neck through an armored door, and the other two were stabbed in the back.”</p>

<p>Walm frowned at the unforgivable words. At least the front entrance had been held up. Although it had been battered with hammers and pierced with ice spears, it was too small a hole for a human to pass through. Only a rat would be able to pass through.</p>

<p>"From behind?　Did they enter through the armoire or the back door?"</p>

<p>"The spies got in before the attack. One for the wounded and one for the healer-magician."</p>

<p>What's the status of the stabber?</p>

<p>The building is home to a rare healer-magician. It's hard to die, if you don't die instantly. ...... I'm not sure what's sticking to the door, it's too heavy."</p>

<p>“You're a bitter old bastard - I'm retreating now.”</p>

<p>The beating had made the building worse, but the main cause was the weight of the human form. Walm grabbed the neck armor and dragged it over the obstacle. A great deal of blood loss is evident from the throat. The cause of death was probably bleeding from a puncture to the carotid artery. The mute corpse is as heavy as a watery straw, and the dripping blood stains are etched into the ground like frayed letters.</p>

<p>We finally meet, but it is not as if we are hugging each other and sharing the joy of reunion. They only look at each other from their toes to their heads, checking each other for injuries.</p>

<p>“What about after this?”</p>

<p>A little dirt is charming. We ask our five-footed colleague for further instructions.</p>

<p>“I would like to move under clear friendlies.”</p>

<p>A simpering answer from the former Konoei. Not unreasonably, Walm continues to foresee danger.</p>

<p>"The troops in the mining town are unreliable. And without a defensive position, how can we protect the target of our escort?"</p>

<p>"Impossible. We can't spare any more orders from the small number of escorts. There are a considerable number of Myard's soldiers stationed in the mountain castle. It's such a commotion. Scouts will surely be dispatched to assess the situation. Until then, a siege is appropriate."</p>

<p>Justin's opinion was reasonable. A chill ran down my spine when I thought of what would have happened if this man had also switched sides, but it was not the right time to do so. Too much intuition would cause unnecessary discord. Walm quickly switched sides.</p>

<p>The policy is being finalized. Walm was wondering how to protect them and how to deploy his men, but a strange smell was preventing him from concentrating. The smell of rotting earth overshadowed the familiar smell of death.</p>

<p>"What's that smell ...... corpses?　No, dirt, huh?"</p>

<p>“Hey, what's going on all of a sudden?”</p>

<p>The knight makes a fuss like a monologue. Justan calls out to him with a questioning look, but Walm, lost in his own questioning, restrains him with a hand, telling him not to interrupt, and searches hard into his memory. Smell is closely linked to memory. If there is a harsh experience attached to it, it is impossible to forget it.</p>

<p>The Highserk Imperial Army's light infantry was a handyman. From dense formations to general contracting, sometimes they even set up a rag shop as carpenters. It was a smell I smelled in the midst of such harsh experiences.</p>

<p>“As I recall, this is the outpost of the Sarajevo fortress.”</p>

<p>A group of bends built for the purpose of forcing the enemy to deploy in battle and bleed before the attack on the fortress. The construction went deep into the ground. The stench of the sediments buried underground and exposed above ground was something that carved itself into our bodies and minds along with our fatigue. The question was, why on earth would there be that foul smell at a time like this?</p>

<p>“Have you smelled this rotten soil since you came to the mining town?”</p>

<p>Justan, who had been quietly watching the process, fell silent for a while and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, it was never this strong.”</p>

<p>“Don't tell me that the first mountain tsunami was also man-made?”</p>

<p>The target was clearly aimed at Ayane. It was too clever to attack after getting information at the site. It would have been more natural to know in advance that the main tunnel was about to collapse.</p>

<p>"Hey, what's going on?</p>

<p>“It means that a second shot might be coming.”</p>

<p>Memories of a distant past life that were being snatched away at the earliest possible moment. It may have been the morning news that was hanging in the air out of habit, but the commentator reported that there was a smell of mold and earth just before the mountain tsunami. I think Walm stopped to watch that high-pitched voice and the horrific images.</p>

<p>Walm and Justan looked at each other and ran outside to stare at the mine as if in a race. The surface of the bald mountain shook slightly. The movement gradually increased and then collapsed all at once. What had been a form before turned into a fluid, as if the mountain itself was melting away.</p>

<p>"Mudslide!　Are these guys just in advance to confirm the location of the important people and finish preparations?"</p>

<p>“We'll never get out of here in time!”</p>

<p>We'll never make it in time!</p>

<p>It could have been a two-stage operation, but that's not the point now. Walm denied the former Kingsguard with a coy smile. The black wave, which had already reached the outer edge of the city, engulfed the houses without abating. The screams of the residents mingled with the sound of crushing. If they see it through to the end, they will follow the same path of destruction.</p>

<p>"That black wave is faster than a horse. It's high ground. Get to high ground!!!!!!!"</p>

<p>Church buildings are often built for emergencies. Even in rural areas, they serve as last-resort defenses against demons and bandits. The treatment center built in a mining town was no exception. Walm, who had tapped on the inner walls to check their strength, told those in the room.</p>

<p>“Get up to the bell tower now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>Ayane stops her first aid treatment and asks Walm as they go deeper into the room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Walm, what's going on outside?</p>

<p>"It's a mudslide!　It's rushing into the mining town. Climb the bell tower."</p>

<p>“There are people who can't move...”</p>

<p>Maia pointed to a line of more than a dozen seriously injured people. Behind them, people were still lying.</p>

<p>"If you ask questions, that's how many will die. Move!!!!!!!!"</p>

<p>Ayane had even experienced a kind of triage at the front lines. One of the most precious things in an emergency is time. The meaning of this was conveyed correctly.</p>

<p>"Put your hands around me, quickly!</p>

<p>“Those who can move, help!”</p>

<p>Ayane and her team climbed the stairs to the bell tower with the patient on their backs. The other guards also helped, but there were not enough hands. We will save what we can. However, there was neither enough power nor time left to save all of them. Walm, carrying the wounded on both shoulders, blasts them as they groan.</p>

<p>“Ugh, ugh, ugh!”</p>

<p>“I can't get up!”</p>

<p>“Move your legs, hold on!”</p>

<p>I'm hurt!</p>

<p>"Get your head in the game!　You don't want to die from that!</p>

<p>The sound of chewing, as if chewing through a fragile house, looms just a few feet away. Pale faces, freshly healed wounds open, blood seeping through bandages. Still, Walm continues to scold and tug in frustration.</p>

<p>"Aaah!　It's coming, it's coming, ohhhh!!!!"</p>

<p>One of the cavalrymen who climbed up to the bell tower one step ahead of the others shouts. The meaning is clear. The screams and shouts are chained together.</p>

<p>"We're at our limit, get up!</p>

<p>“Wait, wait, wait!”</p>

<p>"Fill it up!　Get up high!</p>

<p>I could feel something looming from behind the half-destroyed door, even if I didn't want to. As I stepped onto the spiral staircase, earth and sand poured into the room. The mudslide that devoured the mining town contained sharp building materials, refining its destructive power.</p>

<p>“Shu, guardian chief!”</p>

<p>Help me!</p>

<p>Screams rose up from the following crowd. Some of the wounded who could not be contained were dispersed and laid down in another room. The soldiers who had been unable to bear the pleas for help were taken by the sand and soil.</p>

<p>“You guys, keep crawling!”</p>

<p>Walm, who had unloaded both of his shoulders onto the treadmill, turned back up the spiral staircase, but the first floor was flooded with water to nearly the ceiling. A deafening myriad of crashing sounds echoed through the air. It was not just water. The water, containing large amounts of debris, was tantamount to a blender. Human voices had already broken off.</p>

<p>“Ugh, you stupid bastard!”</p>

<p>Walm swore and turned on his heel. It is needless to wonder who is the greater fool, the soldier who reached out to the people even at the brink of death or the knight who abandoned them because he was unable to save them.</p>

<p>The water level rises, as if demanding more sacrifices. Walm picks up those who were crawling and runs to the top. Those who were trapped in the belfry huddle together without any space between them. The shoulders of the miners, clinging to the pillars, ring the bell awkwardly. It was a bell that announced doom for the mining town.</p>

<p>“The town is sinking.”</p>

<p>"Haha ...... no good. Oh, man."</p>

<p>The depressed miner laughed as if he were talking to someone else. There was no one to reprimand him. A sob mingles with the shaking of the bell. The mining town is helplessly sinking into the mudslide. It just went down to the dark and deep bottom.</p>

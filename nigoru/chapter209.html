<p>Episode 55.</p>

<p>"We still cannot break through the inn town. The terrain is not suitable for the deployment of a large force, and we are unable to take advantage of the difference in numbers. ......"</p>

<p>"The enemy seems to be a force of about 500 men, with a core of lightly-armed infantry from Highserk and the remnants of Myard's defeated army.</p>

<p>“Even if we try to make a breakthrough, the mage soldiers have used up all their magic power in the battle so far and are short of support.”</p>

<p>Gran, the head of the knightly order in Reharzen, quietly listened to the many pieces of bad news that the military commanders were telling him.</p>

<p>"Light infantry from Highserk, huh? No wonder Liard was struck down."</p>

<p>The senior knight Liard, who had ordered the main body to be exposed, was killed. Even with the newly deployed troops, they were unable to take down a single post town. Even though they were one of the few leading Highserk units, two hundred or so light infantrymen would have been able to push them outnumbered. Prioritizing the securing of the landing point, the mishmash of defeated garrisons has become an obstacle here. Unlike maneuver warfare, which requires precise coordination and skill, positional warfare can be deceptive even if the defenders' skills are poor. The example of its operation was being shown.</p>

<p>"The more I learn about this invasive empire, the more I dislike the fact that they are more skillful in defensive actions. No, it's reasonable, considering the state's origins."</p>

<p>Counter-attacks from defensive actions, whether mobile or positional defenses. And annexation and expansion are their forte. The Highserk soldiers are able to fill in the holes in the uneven footing and fighting spirit characteristic of mixed units. The propagation of madness was one of the specialties of the Highserk. The weak soldiers of Myard, who had always been on the run, are now completely ready to do so.</p>

<p>Until now, they had been using the advantage of concentration of numbers and surprise attacks, but it is a fact that the Royal Army of Craist is also pushing too hard. To prevent them from realizing the main attack, they carried out a formation operation called a diversion. They dispersed the enemy's reserve forces into a six-mouthed wide area and had the troublesome enemy detained. On top of that, they pulled out soldiers from each unit who had the aptitude for the water attribute, and after squeezing out the magic soldiers from other countries and even Mako's magic power, they created a road to Lake Celta.</p>

<p>“I didn't think that one more moment would be enough to make the breakthrough.”</p>

<p>What will you do?</p>

<p>"It is too late for that. Call Yout.</p>

<p>“Yes, immediately.”</p>

<p>To put it simply, the firepower support of the magic soldiers is inadequate. In addition, they are also overworking the magic soldiers at the landing site. It was the influence of the Highserk Empire, and by extension, the Liberitoa Trade Federation, that had forced them into this reckless situation.</p>

<p>"Is this part of your plan?　Burn face."</p>

<p>I have no objection to the division of the Duchy of Myard and the Highserk Empire. The division of the northern countries into two was the argument of Hugo Avans, Foreign Minister of the Liberitoa Trade Federation. However, at the root of the matter is the imposition of the Highserk Imperial Army, which is a formidable beast.</p>

<p>The food, fodder, and mage troops offered with polite apologies for not being fully prepared for war were ostensibly a gesture of friendship between the two nations. However, all this was done to prevent the Kingdom of Craist from getting its chestnuts out of the fire. If the war had started simultaneously between the two countries, the Empire would not have been able to reinforce the Duchy of Myard.</p>

<p>Gran knew that this was a malicious invitation, but he had to go along with it. His homeland, originally lacking in national strength, had swallowed up the territory and people of the former kingdom of Ferius and was suffering from digestive problems. Great Outbreak and warfare had also left the farmlands of the former kingdom of Pherius in ruins, which was also fatal. Even if they cut down their mouths by scraping off the demon territory, there would be only a limited amount of folk grass to nourish them. Many militiamen chose sudden and uncertain death and injury over slow and certain starvation. Everyone wanted to choose his or her own fate. Even if it is the same fate of death.</p>

<p>And so the Kingdom of Craist wanted to fight. But a decisive battle in the field with the Highserk Empire's reinforcements was no joke. Even if they won, only the Liberitoa Trade Federation would be pleased. That is why the Celta Peninsula must fall before the rearguard arrives. After confirming his resolve once again, Gran faces the young man who rushes toward him.</p>

<p>"Listen up, Yuto. This is unscheduled, but this is where I'm putting you in."</p>

<p>“I thought you were going to use me to capture the port city.”</p>

<p>"The situation has changed. The situation has changed. They have a small force, but their main force has been stalled. They want to buy time."</p>

<p>He gave Yuto the information in a straightforward manner. Even though Yuto has the potential to be a good fighter, unlike Makoto, he is not naturally suited for warfare. The knight commander had to blast him to get him fired up. He mixed truth and falsehood in there.</p>

<p>"I have already sent a few soldiers and knights from other trails to the sanatorium to protect Ayane and Maia. We should be able to rescue them, but there is always a chance. If they are kidnapped by ship to the Highserk Empire territory, it will be difficult for them to get their hands on them. Just like in the Battle of Sarajevo Fortress."</p>

<p>This young man will be terribly sorry that he was unable to save his childhood friend at the treatment center that was once set up at the bend. After all, the Knight Commander himself had rescued him from that place of wailing. Youto's bitter memories are stirred up, and he bites his back teeth to the point of shattering.</p>

<p>I'm not going to leave again. I'm the one who's going to blow that bulwark down, aren't I?"</p>

<p>Vigor returned to his face, which had been drained from the battle so far. With one more push, Gran puts his hand on Yuto's shoulder and says softly.</p>

<p>"You're our only hope. Please save these girls from the Highserk empire."</p>

<p>“......Yes, I will save them this time.”</p>

<p>"Johanna, you will take the front line in place of the fallen Liard. We don't have enough headmen. The soldiers are getting restless."</p>

<p>What about Yuto's guards?</p>

<p>"I'll let you go for the time being. Renate and Fusei will take over the guard duty. You will not be in short supply.</p>

<p>I'll take care of it.</p>

<p>Let's go, Johanna!</p>

<p>Yuto nodded vigorously and ran off with Johanna. Gran muttered to himself as he stared at her back.</p>

<p>"That's right. Yuto, you should swing your sword without thinking or hesitation."</p>

<p>At first glance, it would be a beautiful sight to see the Knight Commander placing his hopes in the young man known as the Three Great Masters. Even if within it is full of falsehood and deception.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you don't want to talk to Johanna about Ayane?”</p>

<p>One of the knights asked Gran.</p>

<p>"Johanna is stuck in an archaic view of knighthood. That's exactly what it is, a crusty knightly tale. ...... When she learns the reality on the battlefield and gets older, she will be less repulsive. Now is not the time."</p>

<p>“You, the head of the knightly order of Reharzen, are so long-suffering.”</p>

<p>The knight was trying to say in a roundabout way, "Don't spoil him.</p>

<p>"It takes time to develop human resources. Besides, I don't mind a young man who needs a bit of work. As long as it's in their hands. Besides, I have a prior engagement."</p>

<p>“Is it Mako?”</p>

<p>“Isn't it crazy, selfish, and yet endearing that you would kill your childhood friend in order to win the man you love back?”</p>

<p>“...... Gran-sama has bad taste, too.”</p>

<p>Even Gran is a human child. He is willing to reward a girl who works hard for him. Gran, however, is not very good with women, and nearly died when he tried to assign Youto a girl he had set up for him. When Makoto found out about the sweet trap, he became furious and tried to blow up the entire command center and the Knight Commander. It was such a paranoid love affair, and his previous life in the war zone had made murder an easy option in his daily life. Since then, Gran has been the girl's collaborator in the war and love affair.</p>

<p>“So, what about those who went to the sanitarium?”</p>

<p>The Knight Commander asked the squire who was standing by.</p>

<p>"They have already surrounded the place. They are attempting to siege, but we will deal with them as soon as possible."</p>

<p>"That's good. Make sure you take care of them."</p>

<p>If the pawns were beneficial to the nation, Gran was going to reward them. The Knight Commander took one look at the excited young man and watched him with satisfaction. Then, a dazzling flash of light hit the inn town, and debris, and people, scattered like leaves from a tree.</p>

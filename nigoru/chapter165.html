<p>Episode 12</p>

<p>Fort Balgoon, a relay base for the Flame Emperor Dragon Corridor, was a kind of granary that was being fortified, albeit on a small scale. The Transportation Corps replenished the supplies that had been stockpiled after entering Bargoons. The reason for this was to avoid consuming the amount of food and mastered fodder that would be carried to the Duchy of Myard during the march. It would be a complete disaster if they had to resort to military provisions and cavalry fodder because they ran out of food on hand.</p>

<p>Two days after leaving Fort Bargoons, Walm did not overlook the changes that had occurred in the corridor. The soldiers of the Duchy of Myard were wearing equipment that differed from that of their fellow Highserk imperial soldiers. There was no way they could forget the familiar armor they had seen on both sides of the enemy after the Aidenberg invasion. They are guarded by the same kind of troops under Hody's command, the Transportation Guards, most of whom are hired non-combatants, as one might guess from their appearance.</p>

<p>“They're Myard's convoy, trading in goods purchased from the archipelago countries and minerals from the Lehun mines in the former Ferius territory.”</p>

<p>Noticing his gaze, Hodie reveals their true identity. Walm was surprised, although his face did not show it. After all, their homeland, which had always adopted the diplomatic method of war, had made peace with its enemies. They are even trading with each other in this way. Hearing about it and seeing it are two very different things. Although it was forced by the factors of the Great Outbreak, it is a great progress. As economic ties strengthen, factions will emerge to avoid conflict. Walm is neither a doomed warlord nor a pacifist who does not see reality. He hopes that a long period of peace in a state of relaxed tension is the future that Highserk should strive for.</p>

<p>“Many of them are hardly regular soldiers.”</p>

<p>Friug assesses them as leaders of a combat unit. Walm agrees with the company commander's statement. Although they carry only short spears, many of them are missing hand and shin armor. Some of those pulling the carts were even carrying hatchets, machetes, and other farming implements.</p>

<p>“A Myard man who was unloading at Fort Barghoon told me that most of the main force has been taken to the Refun mines and the base of the Celta peninsula, and that the troops in this area are all refugees and farmers who have lost their land.”</p>

<p>"The Kingdom of Craist had targeted the Lehun mines to secure resources, but Myard has narrowly held the whole area by raising troops from all over. Although, instead of Myard, which cannot afford regular soldiers, the Highserk Imperial Army has been the mainstay of maintaining security in the Flame Emperor Dragon Corridor."</p>

<p>Walm searches through his past memories and recalls the map. Refun had become familiar ground during the attack on the Kingdom of Ferius territory. After all, it was the place where he had attacked the mine when he belonged to the Ligurian Light Infantry Battalion, and where he had worked in delayed defense. In the resource-poor Highserk at the time, it was one of the top priority targets for the invasion.</p>

<p>“So both Refun and Celta are lifelines for Myard now?”</p>

<p>"Yes, Myard has not been able to remove the demons from most of its fertile granary areas. In addition to that, it cannot let go of Lehun and Celta, which are key defensive positions due to their rugged terrain. Due to the forces that we have, we will have no choice but to owe Highserk a debt in terms of troops and let them take care of the rear."</p>

<p>“Well, Highserk, as you say, is in no doubt in a situation where he has no other choice but to leave his back to them.”</p>

<p>Walm generally agrees with Friug, but laments the current state of the Highserk empire, saying that the situation is mutual. Highserk, which has lost many of its soldiers and lands, also cannot stand without Myard. The archipelagic countries with which we have deepened our relations also have their hands full with the recovery from the upheaval in the Labyrinth City and with the Republic, which is suspected of involvement in the irregular warfare that took place there. They cannot hope for very generous support. In such a situation, he thought that it would be more desirable for both countries to deepen their co-dependence with Myard and become a “goose chase” between the two countries.</p>

<p>The Myards, who pass by each other, are not in a position to deepen their friendship with the Highserk people by hugging and shaking hands with them. Even so, they have come to accept reality and treat the Highserk as neighbors. Their quick change and resilience may be a trait that has become ingrained in the northern countries, which have repeatedly divided and integrated themselves into a group.</p>

<p>The old castle is visible from afar.</p>

<p>From the moment the ancient castle came into view from afar, emotions swirled like a storm in Walm's heart. Memories that had been locked away in the deep dark depths of his mind came rushing back to him. The castle stood unchanged from the time when he had fled alone. The piles of corpses, the stench of decay that permeates the nostrils, and the deafening screams of death are gone. It was as if everything had been an illusion from the beginning.</p>

<p>After nearly two years, this is to be expected. Memories and scars fade away. Walm, with his liquor, refused to accept them. It was time to face reality. Breathing a little deeper and repeating, he maintains his composure as he chastises his legs for being so unreliable. If you look closely, you can still see remnants of the battle that once took place.</p>

<p>The melted-down keep has been only marginally restored. The temporary walls where Walm fought to the death with his soldiers have been abandoned. Embalmed piles were boxed in and poured into the wreckage of the wall. The so-called “enclosure wall,” a mixture of earthen and wooden structures, was the true form of the wall. Although its defensibility was undeniably lower than that of masonry, it was superior in terms of the length of time required for construction and the procurement of materials. This was probably the result of cost-effectiveness considerations. Even so, compared to the temporary walls that once defended the city to the death, the fortifications are so dependable that they are almost envied.</p>

<p>As Walm enters the gate, he looks around the castle and sees the shadows of soldiers and refugees who are no longer there. He cannot be fooled by the shadows and fall behind in the ranks. I shake the shadows from my mind and step forward strongly. Fortunately, the Transportation Corps led by Hodie, the leader of the group, stops at a supply depot. It was the same place where they had packed miscellaneous munitions during the Great Outbreak in the past. Hody sent out instructions without a break, and the Transportation soldiers began to move around busily, untying the tightly tied securing ropes. In between, the commander of the Transportation Platoon turned to Walm with a renewed look on his face.</p>

<p>“Lord Protector, this is the end of my unit.”</p>

<p>“...... From here, Myard's convoy will distribute the supplies to the various locations?”</p>

<p>Walm had been informed that the main role of the Hodi Transportation Platoon was to travel back and forth through the unstable Flame Emperor Dragon Corridor. Myard's convoy, which he had seen at Fort Bargoons, would play a similar role. Now that they were out of the corridor, there was no reason for them to be working together.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Wollum. Dandurg Castle is the center of accumulation on Myard's side, so we will replace the cargo and fly back to the imperial capital."</p>

<p>“Myard has secured the whole area, including the area along the lakeshore, on the surface, so even Myard's merchants, who are not well protected, will be able to take over the role.”</p>

<p>Friug supplements Hody's explanation. Unlike the corridor, which is only secured by lines, Myard is in full force from the Dandurg area to the lakeshore.</p>

<p>“Thanks to the escort of the chief guard of Walm and the commander of Friug's company, we have had a much easier time on the road.”</p>

<p>"Do not be so awe-struck. The Transportation Corps, which carries the load, should not be burdened with the burden of battle as well.</p>

<p>The “Transportation Corps” has its pride, and Friug, the head of the infantry corps, has his pride as well. Both units were fulfilling their duties, although on different battlefields. In addition, Walm personally has something to be thankful for.</p>

<p>"And it's our way of saying thank you. I've been away from Highserk for a long time and I'm not familiar with the situation and geography. I'm glad to have heard about them along the way. I had no idea the terrain had changed so much."</p>

<p>The topography of the corridor had undergone what could be called an astonishing change. The other name for the dragon species, “a living natural disaster,” is no exaggeration. The local atmosphere and conditions can only be understood by those who have been in and out of the area. It was valuable information.</p>

<p>"That's very kind of you to say. If you don't mind me being a boring guide, I'd be happy to show you the way again on your way home."</p>

<p>The Transportation Platoon commander smiled with a face full of suntan and stains. Walm smiled thinly, too.</p>

<p>“Well then.”</p>

<p>The old, strong Highserk soldier is quick to switch sides, even as he bids farewell. Hodie immediately joined the soldiers and began unpacking. Walm was about to confirm his future plans with the remaining company commander, but Friug was the one who started the conversation.</p>

<p>“Just in time for the welcoming party to arrive.”</p>

<p>The words led me to look ahead, and I saw a group of people heading this way. The group was dressed in what could be described as a “welcoming party”. The closer I got to them, the more uncomfortable and puzzled I felt.</p>

<p>“Chief Protector Walm, they are...”</p>

<p>“I remember ...... those who were in the wartime mixed battalion.”</p>

<p>Tens of thousands of people were crammed into the fort, and he could not remember everyone in the chaotic castle. How could we forget those who had been in the line of battle with us? Those who had made it to the line without missing a beat bowed their heads in unison. They were soldiers and militiamen from Myard's side who were part of the mixed battalion. It had been nearly two years since they had joined different countries. Still, they showed him respect, and Walm returned it solemnly. Not many words were exchanged. Even so, I felt somewhat saved.</p>

<p>"Lord Protector Walm of the Highserk Imperial Army. Welcome back to Dandurg."</p>

<p>The commander stepped forward from the ranks and said in a hushed voice. The voice sounded familiar. The man looks up and his gaze meets the ship's eyes. I have shared the battlefield with him twice. The first time was in the forest on the border, and the second time was here in Dandurg Castle.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the ...... welcome, Lord Fleck. Oh, what a grand welcome, I was really surprised. Did you lose that prominent large shield?"</p>

<p>“That one is too bulky, so it's staying around.”</p>

<p>Walm mentions the former adventurer's name in disgust. The man himself does not seem to be offended, and squints his one-eyed gaze as if the prank has worked.</p>

<p>Episode 22</p>

<p>The damage caused by the collapse of the main tunnel at the Refun mine was unacceptable. The rich iron resources brought from the mine had become an important source of revenue for the war-torn Duchy of Myard. Even the barbaric Highserk Empire in its heyday showed some consideration for the miners living in the Refn mines, especially in the mining towns. Although there are a large number of people engaged in simple physical labor, they are essentially a group of advanced technicians. Once the mines are seized, who will conduct the mining once they have been killed off? There is no end to the list of specialized know-how, surveying, digging, and blacksmithing, and there is no easy way to find a replacement for the group of craftsmen.</p>

<p>A request was made to dispatch a healing magician to the site on the same day, and Ayane complied with the request. In addition to the guards who normally guarded her person, six cavalrymen were to form a chariot. Walm, whose role and affiliation had been left in limbo after his treatment, also followed in the ranks. According to Justus, who had been assisting the guard, there was no one better suited to the job. He was a brigade commander who was just as rough with people as he had been since Dandurg.</p>

<p>“Chief Protector, if you go over that pass, you will find the Refun mines.”</p>

<p>“At last.”</p>

<p>A guard from Highserk, who was running alongside us, announced. He was probably trying to be considerate of his former compatriot, but his words were probably meant with concern. After all, he had not ridden a horse since he was drafted into the army as a light infantryman. The only experience he has had is that of being an ornament on the back of a wagon. When Walm, who had been assigned a horse, announced with a mysterious look on his face that he had never ridden, a painful silence fell over the room. Justin, who is from Ferius and in charge of the escort, was taken aback: "You're a knight, but you can't ride a horse? He was taken aback.</p>

<p>Walm's sense of shame was severely tickled by the humiliation of having an imperial knight take a horseback riding lesson in front of the public. He had learned how to ride a horse, and had made it all the way to Lehun, but the price he had to pay was a dull ache in his buttocks. In my infantry days, I envied the cavalry with horses so much, but now I miss the distant ground.</p>

<p>"I see it. It's Refn. ...... That's terrible."</p>

<p>A voice leaks out from Justan, who was leading the way. Walm's face contorts as he too looks at the expansive view beyond the top of the mountain road. In the past, the Ligurian battalion used Refun as a playground. When they retreated to the Sarajevo fortress, they attempted to harass the soldiers in various ways, and they were reasonably familiar with the geography of the surrounding area. The topography of the area deviated greatly from such memories of the past. Bald Mountain, where the tunnels used to be, has sunk into the ground like a pile of sandboxes trampled on by infants.</p>

<p>“Let's go straight to the local treatment center.”</p>

<p>No one refused Justan's suggestion. The earth was muddy with rainwater, and the mountains were covered with ruts. The rivers flowing through the mountains were swollen and swollen, and they were gurgling as they flowed. Some banks were gouged out as if chewed by sharp jaws. The fact that the bridge leading to the mining town has not collapsed is a testament to the skill of the mining engineers who worked on the construction. Some of the streets were covered with earth and sand that must have been swept into the area, and the residents began to remove the debris.</p>

<p>The smell of the stench of fresh earth permeates the town. The sanatorium, which also serves as a church, is located in a corner near the mine, far from the center of the city. It was built on the mine side of town in order to quickly bring in the wounded who are regularly injured in the mining industry. There is also a treatment center in a large mountain castle that houses a large number of soldiers in the Lehun area and dominates the surrounding area, but it is far from the collapsed mine shaft.</p>

<p>Wheels bounce up and down in the mud, exhausted horses snort and neigh, and a carriage comes to a halt. A shadow jumps out from the back of the wagon without waiting to greet us. Needless to say, it was Ayane and Maia.</p>

<p>“They won't listen to us even if we tell them to wait, so at least let us lead the way!”</p>

<p>Walm was not the only one who panicked. Justan, the escort, jumps from the saddle. The imperial knight, unaccustomed to riding on horseback, was delayed by a tingle in his buttocks and instability. The escorts who advance to surround Ayane ahead of the others feel a sense of dependability and a touch of loneliness. There was no use in indulging in idle sentimentality. Dismounting as if rolling off his horse, Walm entrusted his horse to the remaining Myard's cavalrymen and continued into the room.</p>

<p>Worms.</p>

<p>“I'm going to move the apparatus out of the way.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, we'll block it up.”</p>

<p>Many of the wounded brought in suffered bruises and broken bones. The most severely injured had internal injuries and internal bleeding due to the weight of the earth and sand. Maia cut open the wounds and applied water-based magic to clean the contaminated areas and remove foreign objects. Ayane healed the treated affected area beside her. There are other healing magicians accompanying them, but I doubt they can keep up with the speed of the two. There was no room for them to break into the room.</p>

<p>Walm moved to the outside of the room to keep an eye on things. There are many magic workers who are engaged in the mining industry on a regular basis. There was no need to get involved in cleaning and cauterizing equipment. The thick rain clouds that had caused the disaster were drifting away in the distant sky as if they had done their job. The number of people surrounding the building was decreasing. Ayane and her team were now able to treat the seriously injured, and resources were being allocated to the slightly injured who had been laid outside.</p>

<p>“Master Zidre, this way.”</p>

<p>"Be patient a little longer. It looks like we've got a healing magician from Celta."</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you, thank you.</p>

<p>Many are still buried alive, however. A group of miners, covered in mud, bring in a patient with one arm and one leg secured with braces. They were carried on simple stretchers made of clothes and sticks, as if they were accustomed to handling injured people. The mixture of dry white mud and damp mud stains showed how much they had been engaged in lifesaving without a break. Although the world is surprisingly robust even for ordinary people, not a little time had passed since the landslide. How many more people who would retain their breath would be brought in?</p>

<p>“Is Master Knight skipping out?”</p>

<p>It was Justan, a former soldier of the Kingdom of Ferius, who called out to the pessimistic Walm. He had apparently put his men on guard duty indoors and moved to guard the outside.</p>

<p>“I'm still a serious guy.”</p>

<p>“I guess.”</p>

<p>Like Walm, Justan was observing his surroundings with only his eyes moving busily. Two soldiers conversing without facing each other. From the outside, it may seem like an odd sight.</p>

<p>“I'm not trying to put you down, but you seem more like a skilled infantryman than a knight.”</p>

<p>These words struck at the heart of the matter. Walm, who was called a knight by accident, was born into a family of farmers who knew nothing of warfare. Originally, his role was to cultivate the land. He did not know how to ride a horse or act as a knight. It is only natural that he should appear strange.</p>

<p>"In Highserk, even an infantryman can become a knight.</p>

<p>"An infantryman, huh? It's easy for you to say. ...... Well, if you kill that many people, you can become a knight."</p>

<p>Walm raised an eyebrow at the implication. This escort has an air of being from a war zone. The natural enemy of the Ferius soldiers is none other than the Highserk Empire.</p>

<p>“...... have you met them on the battlefield?”</p>

<p>The two men did not cross blades directly. They only burned the campsite of the bend where they were encamped."</p>

<p>When Walm crawled out of the graveyard in Sarajevo, he burned the camps of the four allied nations that had fallen asleep. This included the Royal Army of Ferius. It would not be surprising if there were survivors from that time. I narrowed my eyes carefully and caught sight of Justan, whose intentions I could not fully grasp.</p>

<p>"It's a very frightening face. At first I wondered if it was the same person from back then, but - oh, it's real."</p>

<p>Our eyes meet. Whether it was the atmosphere he wore or the eyes in his body, Justan seemed convinced that the knight who burned the Sarajevo fortress and Walm were the same person.</p>

<p>“Are you trying to avenge me?”</p>

<p>"After all this time?　If we were enemies, we'd be friends now. Two years is too late."</p>

<p>“But you still talked to me like this.”</p>

<p>One's desire for revenge does not easily fade. Some people hide underground for a century, waiting for a chance to avenge themselves. Walm had learned that lesson from the upheaval in Gundor. He asks her with a question that she follows up with a look.</p>

<p>"......It's like a bitch. Can't the knights of Highserk allow you to even utter a single grudge after getting your ass burned by a blue flame?"</p>

<p>“If you tell me that, I'll have to listen.”</p>

<p>Like it or not, Walm was a knight of the empire. Even if it was an honorary position with no real power.</p>

<p>"Hah ...... if you were a clean asshole, I'd scratch your head in your sleep, but I can't. Ayane-sama would be in trouble."</p>

<p>In the end, all that was uttered was a sigh. Walm had been bracing himself for how much he was going to be told, but he was surprised to find out that he was wrong.</p>

<p>“You're a difficult guy,” he said.</p>

<p>“I don't want to be told by you,......, you served as Ayane-sama's bodyguard a long time ago, didn't you?”</p>

<p>“That's why I barely have the rank of chief guard.”</p>

<p>I'm a fellow guard. Come along with me for an old story. I was a member of the Kingsguard in the army of the Kingdom of Felius. I was sent from the royal capital to Sarajevo to save the country from a war that was going badly. Well, you know how it was. I crawled back to the capital, and what happened to the country - no, what happened to the country was that Great Outbreak. King Ferius was also disturbed by the loss of his brother. Still, as a member of the Kingsguard, I was going to be the sword and shield of the king and of the country."</p>

<p>From his usual behavior, I had a vague idea that the man in front of me was not some kind of small-time soldier. If he was a member of the highly trained and educated Kingsguard of the Kingdom of Ferius, it would make sense.</p>

<p>"But what he did before the fall of the royal capital was to flee. He picked up only his men and their families and fled. When I realized that the country was going to end, my resolve crumbled. Cheap resolve, that ain't funny."</p>

<p>He was smiling, a frivolous smile contrary to his words, but he wasn't smiling behind his eyes.</p>

<p>"After all, I lost my ship and all my men in front of Celta. We literally washed up on the peninsula, and we're a shell after that. I have no motivation to do anything. When my wounds were finally starting to rot, I met Ayane-sama. I thought it was hypocritical of her to heal everyone, friend and foe alike. But as I survived, well, I realized. I realized that those who couldn't save him were only envious of those who could. After that, I became his bodyguard. I was willing to risk my life just one more time. That man intends to serve as a kind of deterrent by staying in Myard himself. It's not as light as he says, but I want to protect it."</p>

<p>“What can I say, you're a romantic. ...... I envy you.”</p>

<p>"Envy, yes. I'm not asking for anything in return, but when Ayane-sama heard that the knights of the empire are returning, all she could talk about was your old stories. I feel a little better."</p>

<p>Walm laughed with Ferius for the first time, albeit with a wry smile.</p>

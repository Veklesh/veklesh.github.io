<p>Episode 36</p>

<p>The uncontrollable feeling of discomfort turned into conviction. Demon Fire" blew up the watchtower, but the fire did not spread to the castle. It was not because they had unintentionally relaxed their hands out of concern for the villages connected to the castle. The walls and barracks, which were built with limited materials, were fireproofed with baked clay. In addition, there were extremely few materials and equipment that could easily catch fire. This was not something that could be achieved overnight. It is likely that the soldiers were instilled with an awareness of fire prevention on a daily basis, and the elements that could cause the spread of fire were removed and isolated.</p>

<p>"This is an order from Ratu-sama. The militia should concentrate on putting out the fire."</p>

<p>“Get the villagers out of the back of the house and into the mountains!”</p>

<p>"The standing guard should concentrate on the attackers!　There are not many of them!</p>

<p>The movements of each and every one of the miscellaneous soldiers were not bad. In fact, they are recovering from the first move made by Demon Fire. The spearmen who were falling below were on the verge of avoiding a fatal attack after exchanging spearheads three times. If it had been a straight spear, the game would not have been decided yet. Walm expressed his fears.</p>

<p>“Was he tricked by those militiamen?”</p>

<p>According to the militiaman who took him prisoner, the commander of the fort was a foolish old general named Ratu. In the old world parlance, he was a man who had fallen off the career ladder. Fort Eskish is not a strategic point, but under the command of an unknown general. The information from Justan, a former Kingsguard, also corroborated this. But let's open the lid. That militiaman was a great actor.</p>

<p>“So that's a nobody?”</p>

<p>The general, who is called a fool, did not jump into the Demon Fire, where the hot wind swirled around him. The ultimate was the “hard blow” that twisted the fireball. The destructive power that shakes off the blue flames and shatters the ground is not enough to kill with fireballs alone. Walm was planning his offensive move, but he was caught off guard by the old general's suspicious movement. He moves to a position where he thrusts out his gold-crusher, on the lookout for magic or skill attacks.</p>

<p>"Hear me, knight of the empire. My name is Ratu. I am the guardian of this fortress, and I am ready to cross blades with you!"</p>

<p>“...... what?”</p>

<p>I can't believe my ears. What did he say? The old man in front of me is the top of the chain of command, the guardian of Fort Eskish. He is in the middle of a killing spree. How could he politely introduce himself? This is not an occasion for exchanging business cards for the purpose of exploring each other. Walm, as a soldier and as an individual, was also confused. The only exception was the Demon Mask that clung to his face. He shuddered as if to say, "You too must compete with the anachronistic name calling. He clicked his back teeth as if to shake them off.</p>

<p>"Concentrate, don't get pushed around. There's not enough chaos to open two gates."</p>

<p>It's a small unit, but the slashing force led by Justan is working hard to seize the gates. The old-fashioned battles of heroic tales do not exist in the northern countries today. They belong to a time long ago, when there was decency and plenty of time to spare. Walm, who avoided answering, held up his axe and spear. Taking silence as an answer, the general, Ratu, tells his men.</p>

<p>"This is my opponent. You guard the gate."</p>

<p>"But they are using Demon Fire. Even Ratu-sama is not a good man."</p>

<p>Despite his reckless behavior, Wollum is able to see what is going on around him. Walm saw that he was a distraction and a diversion. Ratu looked straight at the imperial knight and did not take the soldier's words.</p>

<p>"Rodrigue, it is useless. You can help us after we have defeated the enemies at the gate."</p>

<p>Two of the child soldiers moved away from the troublesome guardian general. If we close the gap with hot air, will we be able to strike them from behind? Walm was about to cut off the reinforcements to the gate, but the sound of the ground popping made him look up.</p>

<p>"You're so inviting, looking away!</p>

<p>“He's going to jump in!”</p>

<p>The old general stepped in with a stride, his white hair flowing. It was as if the walls of a castle were closing in on him. On the battlefield, those who boast of their strength tend to train their upper body and neglect their legs. However, the acceleration that did not match the approaching huge body was due to the well-trained lower body.</p>

<p>"Look at me!</p>

<p>The long arm and the gold-crusher, which reached the height of Walm's head, had the same range as an axe and spear. A poor thrust back could be crushed. He discerns a lateral cleave, turns his upper body away from its forward lean, and uses it in combination with a backward sliding foot. Immediately after, the tip of the metal rod passes just in front of his chest.</p>

<p>Numerous rivets popped out, stirred the air, and made a violent sound. It was like a musical instrument to intimidate the enemy. The passing cudgel head was a signal to step in. No time to waste. With a single blow, the head would fall. Walm wanted to fight a short battle, but before the tip of the club reached his throat, the hilt was pulled back to cover the midline of his body.</p>

<p>“Prevent.”</p>

<p>The magical steel rejects each other. The axe head rests against the surface of the metal bar, and the side blade swings down to the knee. The blow gouges the joint and ligaments, but the huge body literally flies backward. It was a gravity-defying move, but Walm was not so naive as to miss the landing. The Wolm was not so naive as to miss the landing. The thick magical membrane, which was also through the breastplate, did not take away the flesh, but it could not diminish the impact.</p>

<p>“Noooooooooooo!”</p>

<p>Walm's Demon Fire swelled up in the old general's eyes as he let out a cry of pain. Blue enveloped his vision. Rattu shook off the azure flames with a “hard blow,” but there was no imperial knight in the clearing.</p>

<p>“There, huh?”</p>

<p>Walm responded with the biggest blow with his axe spear against Ratu, who sensed the presence from the flank and tried to thrust his metal club into it. The difference in physical strength was crushed by the angle and the first move. As in the first time, the magical forces fought each other. This time, however, the axe spear pushed through the golden rod. The axe head strikes the chest where both elbows are raised. The “hard blow” gouges out the magical membrane and carves a horizontal line on the breastplate.</p>

<p>“Too shallow, huh?”</p>

<p>Blood seeps from the wound, but the redeployed magical membrane staunches the bleeding. The axe spear, which he had readjusted, was struck down from the topmost position as if chopping wood. The axe spear collides with the gold crushing stick raised to the sky. Walm had no intention of going head-to-head with Ratu, who was regaining his stance.</p>

<p>At the moment of impact, he rotates the handle and hits the axe head right next to it, causing the handle to slide away. He planned to take even a few fingers, but the metal crushing rod was bounced off his elbow and ended up scratching the steel carapace.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, the guard of Fort Eskish? Are you out of breath for your age?"</p>

<p>Facing the gold-crusher, which was repositioned in the upper position, Walm rearranged his axe and spear. Despite the provocation, the booming shouts have been muffled since earlier. He hoped that his heart had been broken because he feared he could not win, but he realized he was wrong.</p>

<p>"I'm close to ...... and I can't reach it. Phew, think. Blindfold obstructing my vision, I was caught in a void. Phew, ugh, space and angle. Not enough. Not enough."</p>

<p>Ratu is eerie itself, muttering deliriously as if dazed. His simmering head has quieted as the blood drains out of it. His knotty face trembles with excitement.</p>

<p>“You're a big flirt, aren't you?”</p>

<p>Walm spits out a blue flame. I don't give him time to think any more. Avoiding the aoe flame extending in a straight line, Ratu runs straight to the imperial knight in the lower stance. The unique posture, which wraps around the body, covers the golden crushing stick with its large tree-like body. While it prevents the enemy from grasping the source of the blow, it is a stance that leaves many openings. It is not bad as a high-risk, high-return strategy. Walm, however, has no intention of going along with the forceful push. He uses hot wind and blue flame to cut down and finish with a hard blow. Walm was two steps away from the target when he was blindsided by Ratu's action.</p>

<p>"He swung at me!</p>

<p>He had to take four more steps before he could strike with the metal rod. But Ratu swung with all his might. The roar of the wind was transformed, and Walm finally realized his intention. Walm had forgotten about the earth-shattering blow that had been delivered to him. The gold-crusher thrusts into the ground again, engulfing a large amount of earth and pushing it out into the void.</p>

<p>“So this is the aim.”</p>

<p>The hot wind and flames diminish the momentum somewhat, but the clods of earth mixed with gravel don't stop. You will be blinded - if you fall on your face with a chill, the debris will hit your whole body with a slight delay. The Demon Mask, which had been smashed with clods and debris, blamed Walm for his failure.</p>

<p>“That's not even--”</p>

<p>Out of the corner of my eye, I see a log-like foot. It was flanked and swung over. Walm flips one leg on its axis and, propelled by the hot air, unleashes a 《Hard Strike》. The axe spear that accomplished the collision and the magic power covering the golden crushing rod burst as if they were melting into each other. The result was that Walm's elbows shot up, and the metal rod also pierced the ground.</p>

<p>No matter how good his muscular strength is, the metal rod is useless without a swing. He slips his fingers, shortens the handle, and aims at Ratu. Walm was supposed to make the first move, but he caught sight of something looming below him. The gold-crusher, which was supposed to move only slowly, swelled up in his vision. Walm, half-conscious and with his jaw pulled back, felt a tack snag his cheek.</p>

<p>He understood what had happened. He kicked the club-head buried in the ground to give it a helping hand, which it lacked. The blue flame swirled around him, and from the wave of flame, he made a stab once, twice, as a check. A wiggling gold-shattering stick blocked the tip of the spear.</p>

<p>“Why, what's with this guy?”</p>

<p>Walm stares at Ratu again. His short breathing sounds and exhales suggest exhaustion. The scar on his chestplate was also a sign of superiority. And yet, his relative intimidation has not diminished. He thrusts erratically up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. However, the effective strike was blocked just before the attack.</p>

<p>“Haa, haa, thrust, pull, shave!”</p>

<p>The metal crushing stick was thrust out in time with the stabbing. The gold crushing stick was pressed by the difference in mass, and the tip's trajectory deviated, and the gold crushing stick approached along the handle. Walm reflexively slammed the axe head into the tacks, throwing the axis out of alignment. The axe head is pushed out of alignment with the tack, the wrist is replaced, and the old bone is struck by a hard blow with a stone thrust. It was not a full-blooded blow. Ratu, who thrust out his own shoulder, avoided the blow to the head and at the same time reduced the power of the blow.</p>

<p>“You've learned a few tricks.”</p>

<p>Admiration and abhorrence rose in me at the same time. When we had just crossed blades, I had a chance to take advantage of him. But what about now? Every time they crossed blades, he learned fighting techniques at the cost of wounds and used them as food for himself. It is not something that can be learned on the spot. The skills that he is able to put into practice immediately are the result of the basic training he has accumulated.</p>

<p>"Growing up in battle is the privilege of youth.</p>

<p>Walm let out a small curse. It was a nightmare for an old man halfway to the grave to accomplish. Nowadays, it is difficult to catch a man by the neck with a single blow. He would have to be weakened by the end of his limbs, along with the removal of his magical membrane. A rainstorm of iron from the gold-crusher clubs rattled the Demon Fire, and the axe and spear chipped away at the trunk. Dozens of attacks and defenses were made. How many more blows would it take to topple the tree? The storm of iron and fire, such a feast, was weakened by a call from the outside.</p>

<p>"Don't go along with Walm, these guys are crazy!</p>

<p>The head of the Kingsguard!</p>

<p>After them!</p>

<p>The voice was that of Justan. He was being chased by Ratu's men, and he was fighting off the pursuit with a devilish look on his face.</p>

<p>"You, you, in that armor, are you the Kingsguard in charge of the royal city?</p>

<p>Rattu shouted loudly in front of the former Kingsguard of the Kingdom of Ferius, which had long since closed. Walm would not have it in him to meet with an old man who was as flirtatious as his Demon Mask.</p>

<p>The way is open. Stop the Demon Fire!</p>

<p>The supply of magic is cut off, and the Demon Fire rapidly fades. The sound of horses' hooves scraping the earth approaches from the distance. Walm spins on his heel, as if he had forgotten something, and heads for the gate. The bodies scattered about were the work of Justan and his men.</p>

<p>"Wait, don't go. Don't go!</p>

<p>It was the generals, including Ratu, who were furious. With their weapons raised, they began a furious pursuit.</p>

<p>"Walm!　Come on, Walm, come on, help us!!!!"</p>

<p>In an urgent voice, Justan called for help. Unlike Walm, who had separated himself from Ratu, he was being chased down by five soldiers and was literally about to get his ass handed to him. He shot a fireball at the target as well. Although it was a false threat, the psychological impact on those who knew “Demon Fire” was significant. Against the Yaruku soldiers who took a defensive posture, Justan ran through with the boost of the blast.</p>

<p>“This way!”</p>

<p>It was Douglas who appeared inside the castle, maneuvering a herd of horses that did not like him. The bloodthirsty cutthroats race to get on their horses and go through the second castle gate.</p>

<p>“Don't run away, don't run away, aaaaah!”</p>

<p>“You persistent old man!”</p>

<p>If you shoot a fireball at Ratu to reject his invitation to accompany you, he will use his “hard blow” to knock you down and swing his gold-bar around. He was going to live another fifty years by the looks of him. Walm, who had been struggling due to impatience and poor riding, let go of the reins at the sight of a chill. A gold-crusher stick stuck between the horse and Walm, and the horse, startled, began to run off in an unexpected direction.</p>

<p>“You did it!”</p>

<p>Rattu, who had drawn the longsword at his waist, came running into the scene with glee. Behind him, a large number of soldiers followed. It was a nightmare to be left behind in such a group of exhausted people.</p>

<p>"Mr. Walm, give me your hand!</p>

<p>A hand is extended to the dismayed Walm. He looked up to see Ayane stretching her arm to the limit. He grabs her hand and slips his body between the horse's neck and Ayane's. The horse with the two humans on it neighs and complains. Even so, the horse showed enough horsepower to outrun the group on foot. Walm takes one look at Fort Eskish as it moves away. Ratu, on both knees, was tearing up, hitting the ground repeatedly.</p>

<p>“Guard General, patch me up quick!”</p>

<p>“Any more of that and I'm really going to die.”</p>

<p>“I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die!”</p>

<p>Ratu's lamentations calling for the imperial knights continued until they crossed the mountain.</p>

<p>The horse's legs did not stop, and at regular intervals, the horse's legs would stop.</p>

<p>The sound of horses' hoofs clomping on the ground at regular intervals, mingled with the sound of horses' legs that never stopped.</p>

<p>“It's hot, isn't it?”</p>

<p>Walm agreed with Ayane's abrupt words.</p>

<p>“Yeah, hot, huh.”</p>

<p>The small hand around her waist was trembling. What was he thinking and saying? Was it his own body on fire with blood and “Demon Fire,” or was it the fortress on fire and the bonfires of the people scattered about? He had passed through that castle. How could I not have seen what Walm had done? The vindictive voice of the defender, whose men were burned, still rings in my ears. There is no appropriate place to cut him off. But at some point I had to say it.</p>

<p>"...... Ayane, I killed Makoto. I'm really, really sorry."</p>

<p>Walm revealed the secret that he could not confide in Refn. His hands and voice shake with the knowledge that he has burned to death so many times. Her heart beats like a fast bell, and she tries to keep it hidden by narrowing her breathing. After a long silence, Ayane opened her mouth.</p>

<p>"It's not your fault, Ms. Walm. I should have asked him, but I was too afraid to ask him."</p>

<p>A drop of water fell on the nape of Walm's neck with a disturbed tone. Unable to turn around, he waits for the conversation to continue.</p>

<p>"I was so busy with myself that I didn't look around me and my friends properly. I thought I should just save the people who were being carried in. ...... Maybe I should have gone back to Craist. I thought that stopping at Celta would deter the war. I was just a small person, even though I could be happy. I don't know what to do anymore. What is the right thing to do? Is Yuto next, or Johanna?"</p>

<p>The country and its people have come this far. There can be no peaceful resolution at this point. Neither half-hearted kindness nor lies were acceptable to Walm.</p>

<p>Ayane is doing well. I can't imitate her. ...... But if you can't stand the pressure, the expectations, the reality, then you should leave the Northern countries. There are other places to live in this world besides Myard and Highserk."</p>

<p>As he managed to squeeze out the words, Walm was pierced by a memory from his past. The phrasing is very similar to that of his brother, with whom he had a falling out. So they are brothers after all.</p>

<p>“Will you follow me there, Mr. Walm, if I let go of the war?”</p>

<p>“Uh-oh.”</p>

<p>The girl's words stirred my head to the point of dizziness: the wish of my hometown, the rise and fall of my country, and my duty to my people. A fire of murky emotions is lit from the depths of your heart. Don't look away. If I leave Highserk at this point, what will happen to the people left behind? And what did our brothers and sisters who died in the last war die for? What were they sacrificed for? After killing and being killed so many times, are you going to run away again? You are the only one who can live in peace. After a period of self-loathing, the scales of contention tipped.</p>

<p>In the end, Walm's silence was an answer to Ayane. It was an answer. The girl's hands around his back grow in strength, and their bodies touch each other from neck to waist.</p>

<p>"...... hmmm, sorry, that was mean, you know. I was joking. I know you can't leave someone in need, Mr. Walm. Just give me your back, just for a little while."</p>

<p>Two heartbeats pulsate in the mix. But the distance, which should have been close, was far. The unbearable cold and the unbearable warmth just kept on moving down Walm's back.</p>

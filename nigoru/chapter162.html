<p>Episode 9 The Great Demon of the Land of Fire</p>

<p>Demon Fire once again lights up the hometown of a man who is a dead tree. Only six people in the immediate vicinity were engulfed by the fire. The rest were covered with a magical membrane and escaped burning to death. What a wonderful gift. There are people who can withstand such intense fire.</p>

<p>The dancing blue flames, the smell of burning meat seeping into the nostrils, and the ashes dancing in the air are pleasant. The feast, which could only be tasted through the mask, is transmitted through the whole body. It was vulgar and impolite, but I was not going to put up with it. That is how demons are by nature. Like a little child invited to play, he leaped out and instantly came within a stone's throw of his adversary, a soldier. Despite his startled face, his blade gleamed. It was a defensive action cultivated through repeated training. The demon carelessly extended his fist and slammed the sword down with his wrist. He then embraced the soldier as if in intimate love.</p>

<p>“Yiii, you smell good.”</p>

<p>I whispered in his ear with my canine teeth bared, and the soldier pleaded with searing blue flames and fear.</p>

<p>“No, let go of me!”</p>

<p>He opens his mouth and devours the soldier from the shoulder. The leaked blood is seared by the blue flames and vaporized. In his arms, the soldier shudders like a young girl. The taste is fresh and sweet. The aroma of mellow blood passes through the nostrils. The demon feels intoxicated like a child who has never had a drink. But it is not enough. He continued to vent his long-lasting dry desire as he felt the urge. The demon thrust his hand knife into the convulsing soldier's side, and after finding the object he was looking for, he slurped it down his cheek. The heart pulsing on his tongue, it passed through his esophagus and dropped to the bottom of his stomach.</p>

<p>“Yummy.”</p>

<p>He licks off the blood remaining on his lips with his outstretched tongue. The demon, who has not known how long the feast has lasted, lets out an involuntary sigh of relief, but there is no time to exhale. The demon fire is blasted out to catch the projected magic, and the two collide as if their magical powers are mingled together. It is a good sound that resonates in the pit of one's stomach. Before the next shot begins, he sets his sights on the nearest enemy.</p>

<p>"They're coming!</p>

<p>It was a reasonable trio. The demon runs with a blue flame, but is hindered by the spearpoints placed in its path. The remaining two also set up their weapons and turned to assist. If they stopped on the flanks or on their feet, both of them would come at them. The demon follows its fighting instinct. Before the spear could reach his chest, he dived into a crawling posture.</p>

<p>The spearman, caught in time, slashes back his wrist and tries to strike with a stone thrust, but a launched fist pierces through his chest, along with his protective gear. An elbow sprouts from his back, and the soldier's cheeks bulge and blood pours down. Like dry quicksand, the skin and hair absorb the blood. The two remaining soldiers try to bury their dead friend, but the demon swings the flesh in his hand with force.</p>

<p>“Oh, you lost!”</p>

<p>A dull sound echoed, as if a leather bag full of water had been slammed against the cobblestone pavement. I sigh as I feel interest in the sound that is missing one thing, and at the same time, it has become dull. Holding his dislocated shoulder, he tries to play devil's advocate with the soldier trying to escape out of the gap, but he senses the wind and backs off.</p>

<p>“Howard, pull!”</p>

<p>A storm rushes through the intervening space. It's a familiar attack. Tilting my head away, I see a former adventurer who manipulates the wind. It was the woman who mortally wounded the owner of the mask. The fact that it was all male blood was not colorful enough. Thank goodness for that.</p>

<p>“Good work!”</p>

<p>The demon who crushed the soldier who was about to be drowned by the blue flame on the way to the battlefield at a moment's notice takes away the war hammer. A blade is good, but a blunt weapon has the immediacy to solve things in a simple and clear manner. The demon fights with the swordsman, who cuts at him as a test. A “hard blow” infused with magic power strikes the sword from the belly and disperses the head with a mist of blood. He turns the hammer once and again, as if it were a stick, to see how it feels. Not bad. What it lacks in strength, it makes up for in magic power.</p>

<p>One blow breaks metal, one blow picks back flesh. Every swing brought destruction to something. The human-shaped bonfire that lights up the battlefield flickers with limbs. Corpses pile up, from the fallen to the ashes in the fire. The remaining hostiles could be counted on two hands. It is regrettable, but there is a limit to the number. The spearheads are approaching from the side, and they are ducking, and their eyeballs are being gouged out and burned. The soldiers, deprived of light and mad with pain, wield their spears recklessly. For the ogre, it was more of a boon.</p>

<p>“It's not good to look where you're not looking.”</p>

<p>The soldier, distracted by the ugliness of his friend's actions, hastily lays down his sword and braces himself. A soldier who has lost flexibility is as good as a shellfish. After all, the demons have the tools to pry them open. They use their hammers to bounce off the armor, and they grab the larynx with their bare hands and burn it. It is not so different from cooking shellfish in their shells.</p>

<p>Demon Fire" flickers as he cooks the pieces of meat that stick to the palm of his hand. The demon, perceiving the blow coming from a blind spot with the blue flame it has spread, catches it with the hilt of its war hammer and kicks it in the back with a flailing leg.</p>

<p>“Gghhhh, fuhhhh--!”</p>

<p>“Lefty!”</p>

<p>The girl shouted. The kick dips into her chestplate, causing it to cave in oval-shaped, and she feels several ribs shattering through her sandals, but the demon lets out a disgruntled voice.</p>

<p>"You're overreacting. Get up quickly."</p>

<p>He kicked up with the intention of pulverizing his organs. That concentrated the magical membrane on his abdomen, causing him to jump back and let the force escape. The former adventurer known as Lefty, who rolled and slid on the ground, gritted his teeth and stood up, soaking in blood.</p>

<p>"That's a better face than a blank one. See, if you don't hang on, the woman will die."</p>

<p>“Don't lick me!”</p>

<p>His enthusiasm is good, but his sword does not reach the demon. His magical membrane was being drained by the Demon Fire. If they had fought head-on, Walm would have been sacrificed. The sword and the hammer crossed, the magical membrane peeled off, and the high-pitched sound of metal scraping against metal echoed. The demon may have thought he had more moves than he had time for, but in his opinion, it was a bad move. His breath rises, and he wastes his magical power and concentration.</p>

<p>“Gotcha!”</p>

<p>He swung his foot down in time with his courage. The girl's half-boots are crushed by her sandals, blocking her maneuvering. The demon folds its arms as if to weave through the gap and swings down a war hammer. The girl, having given up on backing down, holds the round shield diagonally upward while bending her left elbow, and supports the entire shortsword with her right hand.</p>

<p>It could be said that this was an astute reaction, but the “hard-hitting” hammer sneered at her and broke through. The round shield, with the reinforcement of the back plate shattered, was separated from the hand, and the arm was bent like a twig. A familiar sight. The demon who had been peering into the man's head searched through his past memories and imitated his tone of voice as he had at that time.</p>

<p>“It broke again.”</p>

<p>The demon laughs innocently. The girl's expression changes from one to the other as she is struck to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>"I'm different from that time!</p>

<p>It's a blatant bluff, but it's a very pleasing one. This girl even satisfies my taste buds. The demon, plagued with a sense of inadequacy, finds joy in the way her face contorts for the umpteenth time. She wields her weapons carelessly. The whole body is scraped away by the simple blows scattered up and down, left and right. Lefty and the other soldiers, who were now in the game, interfered, but the steps were only slightly extended. Two or three more to go, and it's deadlocked.</p>

<p>The demon, who had become enamored with the girl, came to his senses when he felt a chill. His skin, which was supposed to be heated, was now cold. Among the high-quality sacrifices, there was one who was more attractive to the demon than the others. I know who it is. The bloodline of a man who straddles the world is a bloodline from which men are born and fall. The man's brother is also loved by the struggle. He thought he had killed his brother, and the will had returned to his dazed face. The demon is delighted by his icy, piercing gaze.</p>

<p>“Demon Fire” for the younger brother and “Freeze” for the older brother. They are so close."</p>

<p>The world cooled down as if it was rejecting Demon Fire. The grass and trees that were about to be burned down seemed to be frozen in flames. Every time the soldier steps out, the space makes a crackling sound and the ice squeaks. A symbol of the exiled Highserk warrior from the Highserk Empire who has risen in a short time to become one of Liberitoa's most powerful men. The Haze of Freeze, which freezes all things, challenges the great ogre of the nation's burnings.</p>

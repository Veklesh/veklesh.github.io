<p>Episode 51 Ice Road</p>

<p>Waves ran across the surface of the dark lake as if a blank sheet of paper had been disturbed with ink. They were the wake waves generated by a patrol ship belonging to the Myard navy. Unlike mainline vessels and transports, whose towers and decks are becoming larger and more multi-layered, the smaller patrol vessels have a smaller drainage capacity, and compared to larger vessels, even give the impression of flying away when they blow. However, her speed and excellent turning ability made her a versatile vessel, and she was one of the ships given the important task of surface surveillance.</p>

<p>“It's awfully cold!”</p>

<p>Edme, a sailor, blurts out, his voice drowned out by the creaking of the hull and the cold wind. The thin mist that clung to the ship was tinged with a piercing coldness. Her body shivered with a desire for heat. Edme's nose, reflected in the water, is slightly reddish, making her look like a silly clown.</p>

<p>He sniffs, shrugs into his cloak, and exhales. He stares resentfully at his breath as it dissipates into the void, but his resistance is futile. The red-nosed man is a member of Myard's navy, one of the most elite in Lake Celta. He is a sailor who is not intimidated by the ferocious lake dragons, who sometimes fight over control of the water and slash at other nations' vessels. However, he was not fond of the cold.</p>

<p>He is thinking in vain to drown out the cold air, but his gaze is on the ground below him, searching without care. The seemingly endless darkness makes it easy for the boat to blend in. Edme gazes at the surface of the lake, but suddenly a flame lights up at the edge of his vision, and he is lured by the light source to gaze at the land in the distance.</p>

<p>“It looks warm. ...... No, that's inappropriate.”</p>

<p>I blurted out at the warm light, but I didn't envy it in the slightest. After all, at Cape Gala, one of the six mouths of Celebes, located at the base of the blaze, fierce fighting continues day and night.</p>

<p>According to what we heard from the cargo handlers when we were replenished at the port, rumors were circulating that a rear treatment center had been forward-deployed to Cape Gara due to the severity of the damage. I also heard that a squadron of Highserk Imperial troops, which had been pulled back from the front line due to wear and tear at the beginning of the war, was scheduled to be deployed as soon as it could be reorganized. Although Edme prided himself on being a first-rate sailor, he was aware that his fate would not last so long when it came to land battles. The Myard navy and the high officials of the duchy must agree with him. Otherwise, the navy would have been worn out by the past wars, as waterborne forces were converted to land-based forces.</p>

<p>Barring accidental battles, Myard's navy will avoid fleet battles until the Highserk Imperial Guard arrives to help them, and will hold fast to the waters of the peninsula and the water transport routes. The Liberitoa Trade Federation navy, which does not want to be depleted, will only look on from a distance. No matter how superior they are in terms of the number and skill of their water magicians, the total number of Liberitoa's naval forces exceeds that of Myard's navy in terms of size alone. It is not an opponent that can be dealt with in a single handed manner.</p>

<p>“You're just making up big reasons as usual, and I'm really getting tired of it.”</p>

<p>Preservation of forces is ridiculed as the Myard navy's signature. Humiliating and infuriating, but it may capture the essence of things. In the past, with the country's strength, it would have been possible to replenish both manpower and naval vessels, but in the current climate, that is unlikely to happen.</p>

<p>Unlike on land, where people compete for a few meters, on the water, passive patrol missions continue. For Edme and the other sailors, guilt toward their compatriots and the tasteless poison of a temporary peace slowly turns.</p>

<p>"What the ......?　That shadow."</p>

<p>The fact that Edme was able to detect something unusual on the surface of the water, which should have remained unchanged, was the result of his experience and training as a sentry. The moment he perceived it, a chill ran down his spine, a chill he had never felt before.</p>

<p>"There's an obstacle in the water!</p>

<p>Edme's alarm was swiftly effective. Leaning forward into the bowstring, the fellow who had spotted the obstacle shouted in a screeching voice, "Hey!</p>

<p>"Hey!　There's a reef, a reef on the starboard side!</p>

<p>“Full rudder!”</p>

<p>The captain's short, yet clear, command to turn the helm instantly brings a kind of serenity to the ship. Independently conscious people start moving as if they were a single cog in a wheel. The helmsman turns the tiller wheel, and at the command, the sailors run up the transverse static line and crowd around the dynamic line.</p>

<p>“Hurry, hurry!”</p>

<p>"Where's the rudder?</p>

<p>“We're full!”</p>

<p>Edome looks up to the heavens at the helmsman's heartless reply. Normally, the patrol ship was nimble and excelled in small turns, but at this moment, the turning hull seemed slow and even sluggish.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We're going to hit it."</p>

<p>“Brace for impact!”</p>

<p>Convinced of a collision, Edme hugs the gangway. Soon after the captain's warning, his body floated away from the impact. The intermittent vibrations and noises echoing from the bottom of the ship to the deck were fearless and disturbing. After a little more than ten seconds of unbearable time, the sailors regained their voices.</p>

<p>"We're off the reef!</p>

<p>“Get the rudder back, we're going straight!”</p>

<p>The early evasive action bore fruit, and a fatal stranding was avoided. Even so, the ship was not in danger of sinking. Reports were repeated at a dizzying pace about the state of the hull.</p>

<p>"Port side, flooded from below the surface!</p>

<p>"Light control is off, hurry up to see where the damage is!</p>

<p>“What the hell is going on, there's a reef here!”</p>

<p>"It's not a reef, it's ice. It's not a reef, it's ice, and it's thick as an ice shelf.</p>

<p>That's crazy. You're looking at the wrong thing.</p>

<p>"This is an ice-free lake, even in winter!　It can't be ice floes."</p>

<p>The sailors were distraught at the unusual phenomenon that had occurred in the garden of Celta Lake, which is the dominant body of water. Edme, too, is bewildered and dizzy from the aftermath. In contrast to the mayhem on the patrol boat, the captain, who was staring into the silent darkness, stopped one of the mages and gave him an unbelievable order.</p>

<p>“Mage, shoot a fireball into the sky!”</p>

<p>“Captain, that would put us on the enemy ship...”</p>

<p>“Shut up and shoot up!”</p>

<p>The mages, who had been hesitating under the pressure of the angry atmosphere, kneaded their magic power and launched a fireball directly up into the sky. The unreliable stars were replaced by the sun, which was driven out by the twin moons, and the illumination of the fireballs violated the dark night. Countless shadows spread over the water.</p>

<p>“Hey, people!”</p>

<p>It was an unbelievable sight. Countless people were walking on the surface of the water, gasping for breath. Or, more precisely, enemy soldiers were crossing the frozen surface of the lake.</p>

<p>"Oh, they're plotting against us, ring the ship bells like mad!</p>

<p>“Ah, there's a light!”</p>

<p>The captain's voice, filled with bitterness, rings in my ears. The captain had ordered the bells to ring early to signal the surprise attack, but there was already no need. A portion of the frozen lake surface glowed brightly, forming a line extending toward the patrol boat. Unable to bear the burning retina, Edome closed his eye lids, but immediately afterward, his entire body was tortured by the impact and countless pieces of debris.</p>

<p>Edome, who was submerged in the water without even realizing what had happened, clawed at the seaweed, but the increasing pain and cold gradually obscured his consciousness, and he slowly sank into the dark water. Fortunately or unfortunately, the man shared his fate with the boat and his friends until the last moment.</p>

<p>◆</p>

<p>The burning patrol ship reflected in the water mirror, ironically even beautiful. However, under the surface of the water, countless people who had been injured by the “holy blow” were drowning. The sound of the boat burning down seemed to represent their demise.</p>

<p>“Arghh--!”</p>

<p>Yuto swallows the lowest sour taste that rises to his throat, and deliberately turns his attention away. Don't take it seriously, don't imagine what they will end up like, Yout knew that his imagination and empathy were avenging him. Even Yuto knew that his imagination and empathy had their downsides. Still, it is possible to fool them and dull their senses.</p>

<p>“Damn it, I've been exposed!”</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?</p>

<p>The army that had been advancing stealthily from the ice shelf was finally exposed. Not only the soldiers and squires, but even the knights of Reharzen, who are accustomed to rough times, showed a wavering of will, but the man in overall command of them said flatly, "What are you upset about?</p>

<p>"What are you upset about? Land is just around the corner. We will launch a surprise attack on the Celta Peninsula as planned. All hands on deck!　We're going to push through."</p>

<p>There is already no need to hide in the dark. Following the orders of Gran, the leader of the Knights of Reharzen, the troops, disregarding concealment, rush toward the land.</p>

<p>“Yout!”</p>

<p>Youto feels reassured by the familiar voice. It was one of his childhood friends who had wandered into the other world with him, a world he could never step on again.</p>

<p>“You're Mako?”</p>

<p>"Huh, it's me. I ran out of magic, so I've been dropping back to replace Liberitoa's unit."</p>

<p>Makoto was smiling a smile that was not appropriate for the occasion, but behind that smile was a hint of fatigue. He was obviously bluffing.</p>

<p>“Are you okay, you look pale?”</p>

<p>“Haha, it's not just me, you know.”</p>

<p>A small group of people with wobbly gait followed behind the childhood friend. They behaved as if they had been heavily intoxicated by alcohol, but in reality they were mage soldiers who had suffered serious magical intoxication due to a lack of magical power. They had been recruited from all over the army to connect the ice shelf from the land to the Celta Peninsula. A surprise attack by skipping Cape Raga. It is easy to talk about on the table. In order to realize this surprise attack, the majority of the regular soldiers from before the Great Outbreak, as well as water-attribute magic soldiers, were pulled out.</p>

<p>This would bring about the exhaustion of forces on all fronts and a lack of magical support. However, if they cut corners and slowed their frontal offensive, they would arouse suspicion among Myard and Highserk's imperial forces. The militia of the former Ferius group was literally grinding itself to a pulp.</p>

<p>The devastation of the friendlies, the exhausted childhood friends, and the coming tragedy on the Celta peninsula. How could this have happened? Yuto's thoughts were greatly overshadowed.</p>

<p>“After all, I'm going with you.”</p>

<p>"No. The magic power was used up freezing the surface of the lake. And the wound on my arm hasn't healed yet."</p>

<p>He must have seen through my weak inner feelings. With a snap, he ordered his painful childhood friend, who had become a one-armed man in the accidental battle. I don't want to touch you. Yout still had to say it.</p>

<p>You have to let go of your naivete, I have to do it. Yuto swore in his heart to his childhood friend who had become a ship's arm. At the Sarajevo Fortress, Ayane was taken away by the Demon Fire due to his own lack of strength. After that Great Outbreak, Ayane seems to have drifted to the land of Celta, but she has not returned from Myard, where she was an ally, and even contact has not been made. Because of the rarity of her abilities, she continues to be kept under house arrest and used. The head of the knighthood in Reharzen told us this. I didn't want my childhood friends to lose anything more.</p>

<p>“I can't even breathe a word when you say that.”</p>

<p>"Don't worry. I'll take Ayane back. The three of us will also invite Maia and Johanna to have dinner with us."</p>

<p>"......Yeah, sure. All of us."</p>

<p>The strange lack of crispness that you would not expect from Mako, who usually speaks with a light hearted manner. Yuto wondered about this discomfort, but he could not pursue the matter any further under the circumstances just before landing on the peninsula. Even though they had succeeded in the surprise attack, their presence was exposed by the patrol ships just before the landing. Even though the main force was directed toward Celebes Rokkou, it was the enemy's home base. There are certain reserve forces and detachments on duty.</p>

<p>“Don't slip on the way home.”</p>

<p>“You too, Yuto.”</p>

<p>Makoto waved his remaining arm wide like a dog's tail and saw me off. The place and time were different. Still, Yuto recalls the return trip home from school, which now seems so familiar. After saying goodbye, Yuto heads for the front of the army.</p>

<p>Passing through the crowded ranks, Yuto's eyes were glued to the face of a Liberitoa soldier. He was not an uncommon sight. For this operation, even Liberitoa's magic soldiers were on loan. In fact, it would have been difficult to ice the lake surface without their cooperation, which was still working at the front of the line.</p>

<p>"Hayes, fall back. Let's get the hell out of here."</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>

<p>I searched my memory, but it was not someone I knew. But his face and especially his eyes were familiar. It could be the battlefield. Where, where, where?</p>

<p>"I'm an idiot at a time like this. Concentrate, it doesn't matter now."</p>

<p>I push all thoughts out of my head and stare at the beach. Even though the rocky coast was not originally intended for landing, let alone boats, it was not without enemy soldiers. Youto is in charge of supporting the landing and forming a breakthrough. He fires a “holy shot” toward the enemy soldiers gathered sparsely. The rocky beach is blown off its feet, and the remnants of what used to be human bodies soar into the sky like leaves. Some even cheered. A friend praised Yuto's action and clapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Wow, look at that. They've been obliterated!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about the little things, secure the bridgehead at once. Don't sweat the small stuff. Get the bridgehead in place at once.</p>

<p>Don't stop. Push inland.</p>

<p>We had done our job and buried the enemy standing in our way as before. But there is no joy, no sense of accomplishment. How much better it would have been if there had been nothingness in his heart. Yout's face is simply distorted with grief. In the midst of the blitzkrieg landing operations, there was no adult present to notice the boy's silent cries.</p>

<p>Episode 63</p>

<p>The walled corridor, with its chaotic flow of people, was suddenly illuminated. Unknown attack magic grabs the soldiers by the arrow's width, and the breastworks they rely on become a myriad of malice, raining down on the corridor. Patres, a soldier belonging to the garrison of Fort Raga, quieted his body and crawled on the floor.</p>

<p>“It's not good.”</p>

<p>The basket-carriers pass by on their heels, as if there were no one lying down. One or two of them grunted and fell down, but no one knew how to stop.</p>

<p>“Damn the Knights!”</p>

<p>On a battlefield where all manner of dangerous objects come and go, the identification of the offensive magic that strikes the earlobe is a trivial matter. It would be foolish to count the number of knocks on the pavement. For now, it's all I can do to keep my hands busy. Shredded metal, gray and pale red pieces of flesh blocked my way, and a reddish-black mixture of liquids made me fall over.</p>

<p>After struggling for a moment, he reached his fallen comrade. There were no good intentions. The burden on the patrollers would increase if their colleague remained in bed. With a friendly word, he brushes away the debris of the sleeping assistant.</p>

<p>“Hey, get up, if you're safe, get on with it - ugh.”</p>

<p>As he removed the debris from his helmet, the patress gulped. The face to be seen was nonexistent. It was picked back from the tip of the chin to the eye lids, leaving only a flat, red plane. The patress looked down and took over the object the corpse was holding and threw it under her eyes. The baby-sized rock emitted a guttural sound, causing the knight of Reharzen, who had released the magic, to stagger and stroke out.</p>

<p>“Suck it up!”</p>

<p>Even magic users who bend reason were equal before the mass-backed projectile. In a moment of joy, a comrade-in-arms, who had leaned out of the chest wall damaged by the projectile, was pulled up by an invisible hand and lifted off the ground. It was a gust of wind from wind magic. With a scream, the familiar voice slid to the ground.</p>

<p>Patres, who had survived the gale by clinging to the back of the chest wall, picked a couple of pebbles from a high pile and threw them into the air. The mismatched pebbles hit the ground and dented the raised shields, but that was all. Just as he reached out to expand the battlefield, he heard a call.</p>

<p>"Squad leader!　There you are."</p>

<p>His reaction was delayed by the unfamiliar title. This was a common problem with unwanted promotions in wartime. Patres was now in charge of a newly created unit. It sounds good to say that it was a temporary formation, but in reality it was a hastily created unit made up of a random mix of surplus materials. There was neither solidarity nor honor.</p>

<p>“...... What's going on at this busy time?”</p>

<p>“I was wondering if you could send reinforcements from your command post on the north wall...”</p>

<p>Anger swelled before the poor liaison could finish.</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous, where do you have that many people left over!　All I see are wounded and dead. Not just me, the messenger, but even the old Transportation Corps men and the kids who cook the rice are fighting."</p>

<p>The team members guarding the two wings of the Patres were old men with missing front teeth and boy soldiers who may or may not have even grown hair. To put it bluntly, they were all old enough to miss their coffins and cribs. The men at the fort's command post would be quiet if they were shown this full complement of men.</p>

<p>“I don't care if you're an old man or an old woman, as long as you're in one piece.”</p>

<p>The liaison pleads half-heartedly.</p>

<p>"We're under siege. I won't give up even half a man. Find someone else."</p>

<p>The old man and the boy, who had been severely criticized in the middle of an argument, were busy throwing stones at each other. In the walled corridor, where distance and height are guaranteed, even these men, with all their faults, can be soldiers. The patresses chased away the liaison men with a howl. Not to be outdone by the north wall, the south wall is also in danger of falling. Untreated, the seriously wounded groan, and the dead are left exposed to the wreckage. Some are fighting without arrowheads. But it was worth it. The fall of the fort meant the fall of the Celta Peninsula.</p>

<p>Cape Raga, located at the eastern end of the Celta Peninsula, is the main transportation route from the Kingdom of Craist to the military port city of Ancushio in the shortest possible time. The well-developed road could be a good invasion route if turned around. Although the outpost was lost, the main objective was Fort Raga, which straddles a narrow ridge. The fort was surrounded on both sides by ridges and on the front and rear by walls, and as expected, the oligarchs were able to hold off a large force.</p>

<p>The peninsula was to be held at Zelebes Rokkou, the outer line of the mountain range, until the decisive battle in the rear. Such a defensive plan collapsed in a daze due to a surprise attack from the ice road connected to the rear of Cape Raga. The ice road was a straight road that normally could not be bypassed. A simultaneous siege of the northern and southern walls was not envisaged. The troops and materials that were supposed to be poured into the fort were split in two, and the fort was about to be crushed between the vise of an army.</p>

<p>“There is no movement in the inn town. ......What happened to that Highserk unit?”</p>

<p>Cape Raga is not the only concern. I probe into the distance through the gap between the half-damaged arrowheads. It was Patres who transmitted the order to the troops who drew a second line to the inn town. In summary, buy time with yourselves. It was a miserable instruction. In his role as a messenger, he knew the surrounding terrain and had access to the command post. Therefore, he understood the situation better than the soldiers. Unlike the cramped lakeshore, it would be easy to deploy a large force if the lodging towns were overtaken. If this happens, the defense relying on Rokkou and the huge lake will collapse. Each of them would be destroyed individually, and a military port city with no good defensive facilities would easily fall.</p>

<p>This is an old war situation nowadays. Starting with a surprise attack from the ice road, followed by an explosion and fire in the inn town, a forced landing from the lakeshore, and the cutting off of the ice road, the inn town had fallen into an eerie silence. The situation took two or three turns, and nothing is certain. If there is a simple fact, it is that the Patres are still fighting.</p>

<p>For a moment, the group leader's thoughts skipped from reality, but then he returned to it with a ground shaking. Instead of subsiding, it became stronger, like a chain of events. Someone shouted strongly.</p>

<p>"The side guard tower is going to collapse!</p>

<p>Run for it!</p>

<p>With an unbelievable warning, screams rose from the two neighboring groups. One of the side towers, the key to the offense and defense, protruding from the castle wall, was collapsing like a fragile pile of sand.</p>

<p>“Tunneling tactics by magic soldiers!”</p>

<p>The division of the soldiers in the inner area of the fort into two halves has reduced the strength in terms of both quantity and quality. This directly affects our surveillance and interdiction capabilities. Patres realized belatedly that the heavy fire from the precious mage soldiers advancing was also to divert attention from the tunnel soldiers' magical excavation. The tower collapsed completely, scattering dust and screams and spewing debris like a mudslide.</p>

<p>Some of Craist's soldiers were buried alive as collateral damage, but there were no cheers from the side of the walkway. The slope was a valuable foothold for Craist's soldiers, who had been trying to breach the walls through the damaged ramparts and gates.</p>

<p>“Let's go cover the side defense towers!”</p>

<p>We proceed down the corridor with the squad, which is now alone with three men due to the loss of constant numbers and wear and tear. If even the patrollers die, the old man or the boy will be the temporary leader of the squad. But they still insisted that they were a unit. It was really the end of the world.</p>

<p>The dust from the former side guard towers, which had been turned into an attack point, served as a smokescreen and obstructed the view. Broken spears, mute corpses, and dirty water buckets were scattered in a jumble at our feet. At the end of the crumbling corridor, something crawls out of the grayness. Heavy breathing, metal and scrap metal rubbed against each other like breathing. Craist soldiers were regrouping on unstable footholds, climbing up the rubble. Not being told by anyone, they threw stones single-mindedly at the unseen enemy.</p>

<p>Each time they did, a short scream and a dull thud would be heard. Around us, about 20 soldiers had gathered. They were the residue of the oil presses that had squeezed the oil called manpower. The sound of the slope was getting closer and closer. Pebbles were thrown recklessly into the air as if fighting over them. Hands overlapped over one gravel.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way, get out of the way!!!!”</p>

<p>The impatient compatriot snatches the projectile from the patres' hands. Time is wasted arguing. As he picks up another pebble scattered on the floor, a strange sound is heard.</p>

<p>“Boo-hoo-hoo -- geez, ah.”</p>

<p>The somewhat silly sound was emitted from the mouth of the soldier who had just laid his hands on me. A spear was growing slimily on his breastplate, as if ejected by wind magic. Looking down below, a shadow leapt out of the dust cloud. It was the knight of Reharzen, approaching with nimble footsteps that made one feel neither the weight of his armor nor the poor footing.</p>

<p>"Here he comes!</p>

<p>"Drive them off!　Ouch!</p>

<p>The knight's comrades, who were blocking his approach, unleashed their weapons. After a moment's cross, a hand and a head fly off. The streamlined helmet tilts. A sticky killing intent was directed through the dimly lit slit. Throwing the gravel in his hand, Patres drew his sword. It was only with the blessing of the city walls that he was able to fight seriously. He was not prepared for a confrontation with a white-army fighter. Regret also rubbed against the spine of the sword for a moment.</p>

<p>It was a tremendous sword pressure. The sword was one-sidedly flicked over his head, and a slash back came at his unprotected chest. The blood-smeared blade was shining dully.</p>

<p>“Ugh, wow.”</p>

<p>Liquid dripped onto Patres' body. It was not raw warm return blood. It was a shuddering coldness. The death-sprinkling knight loses his posture and rolls down the slope with the water bucket. When he turned around, he saw a toothless old soldier.</p>

<p>“Heh, the knight rolled away.”</p>

<p>“Huh, haha, thank God.”</p>

<p>His smile was a combination of fear and excitement. The patress laughed, caught by the squad members.</p>

<p>The old soldier dumped the abandoned water bucket. It was cold and stinging, but this wetness would disguise the liquid that had leaked out at the moment of his death. The war situation was only getting worse. I don't know how long the fortress will last. Even so, we could do something to help them out, even if only a little. The group leader was helped up by a boy soldier and returned to battle.</p>

<p>The dust that had been rising gradually settled. The patrollers had not yet noticed that the inn town, which had remained silent in the closed field of vision, was shaking.</p>

<p>◆</p>

<p>“The Highserk imperial troops that forcefully landed from behind have taken up positions in the inn town.”</p>

<p>“Yuto-sama has been killed, and Renato-sama and Efsei-sama seem to have been killed together.”</p>

<p>The north and south walls of Fort Raga have yet to fall.</p>

<p>Johanna has regrouped the remaining troops and is retreating.</p>

<p>It is difficult to rebuild the ice roads, and the few who are left can hardly come and go.</p>

<p>In the headquarters, where there were no curtains or chairs, Gran accepted the news that came in one after another without moving his eyebrows. He solemnly gave orders and just silently waited for the outcome of the battle.</p>

<p>“You came, Johanna.”</p>

<p>A female knight, who was ordered to take part of the command, rushes into the military camp made of a wall of squires and knights. Her elegant appearance was covered in mud and blood, and her armor was damaged everywhere.</p>

<p>"I am sorry. We have lost the majority of the men we had entrusted to you. And even Yuto, what should I tell Makoto ......?"</p>

<p>Johanna bit her back teeth in shame. She is a girl madly in love. What will she do if the person she loves is dead? Avenge him or become a lethargic shell of a person, even Gran can't read her.</p>

<p>"The Highserkers have stirred us up, and we've stirred them up, too. ...... I'll be brief. The situation sucks."</p>

<p>"I'm going to make Cape Raga pass through no matter what it takes. I will use up my life."</p>

<p>Johanna revealed her resolve. Even the famously robust Zerebeth Rokkou would fall if pressured from the inside and outside. Half a minute would have been enough to open the way. That is why Gran understood the situation correctly.</p>

<p>"It's a waste of time. We are already stuffed."</p>

<p>The female knight, probably thinking she had been shunned, said to rouse herself.</p>

<p>"Commander, what?　I can still do it, I must do it!　Indeed, the spearhead was destroyed. The rear lines of communication have been cut off, troop by troop. But the number of friendly troops still exceeds 2,000."</p>

<p>"We have a little time. Let me give you one last instruction."</p>

<p>There was no desk to write on, no map to point to. Gran pulls out his sword and writes the current situation on the ground with the tip of his sword.</p>

<p>"The dead soldiers who ran into the ice road with their ships did not aim for my head, but instead ravaged the rear of the ship and took up position in the inn town. Their aim was confusion, and to draw a line when Cape Raga fell. Maintain a defensive line. This was probably the minimum goal."</p>

<p>Gran drew the line emphatically at Cape Laga and the inn town.</p>

<p>"When the situation improves, the aim is to plug it. That thing, together with Fort Raga, is not the earliest line of defense. It is a plug that will block us on the lakeshore. If the two corks are not pulled out and time passes, you know what will happen."</p>

<p>Gran continues in a teaching tone.</p>

<p>"We are a great force to be reckoned with at first glance. The Highserk soldiers are so intent on maintaining their defensive line that they could be mistaken for abandoning Cape Raga. But we are only 2,000 men on our hands. We have failed to gamble with what we have. We are a qualitative mainstay isolated in the enemy's stronghold. The enemy will push in, abandoning the six remaining outposts and abandoning the vertical depth of the defensive line. As far as I'm concerned, it doesn't matter if it's the Transportation Corps or the militia that can't fight. They will uproot us. They intend to drive us into the Great Lake with a sea of men."</p>

<p>Even the inexperienced Johanna was not stupid. Re-aware of the war situation, Johanna asked the Knight Commander in a trembling voice.</p>

<p>“Why are you doing that now?”</p>

<p>"Because it became necessary. I will be the Lord. Gather up the good remnants and retreat from the shattered ice road. ......What's your reply? Johanna."</p>

<p>The knight's pale face is now tinted with anger as she looks at him.</p>

<p>"Are you serious? You're saying ‘Tono’?　It's a far-fetched suicide, isn't it!　As the leader of the knighthood, you have the duty and responsibility to bring the soldiers back home and rebuild the wounds of the defeated war. You should return home even if you have to live in shame. Don't let a defeated general choose his own way to die!</p>

<p>Gran was prepared for some backlash, but his eyes widened at the harsh words. It was as if to say. In this gloomy predicament, that was the only thing that was painful.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, this Gran is so ashamed of himself and so pessimistic about the war situation that he chooses to commit suicide. Don't make me laugh!　If I could have lost the battle, I would have already thrown away all the stones, including you. They would have my head if they could not be bothered to show any sign of damage. A blowout, that's what Liberitoa would like to see. The timing of their move is simple. The time for them to move is simple: when I am defeated, and when my forces have swelled to the necessary numbers to match the losses and the results of the battle. It should be soon."</p>

<p>“The Commander is indispensable to Craist.”</p>

<p>"Indeed he is. Weighing everything in the balance, which is heavier, my life or yours? If it were ten elite men, it would be me. If it were a hundred?　If it were hundreds?　There is no such value. I can no longer move from here. That's the way it turned out. They made me do it."</p>

<p>When Johanna fell silent, Gran gave the order that there was no room for argument.</p>

<p>"Even if we gave first aid with the mages who can move, the shattered and melted ice road is too thin. It has become a spider thread. If you cross it with a large force, you will only break into a thousand pieces and fall into the lake. You must regroup with those who remain on the other side of the river. If you show the slightest sign of weakness, Craist will follow the same path as Felius. As the Commander of the Knights, I order you again. Take your forces and cross Lake Celta. We'll be standing here for as long as it takes. Go quickly, you're in my way."</p>

<p>“You have ...... agreed to the end.”</p>

<p>After watching Johanna leave, Gran looks around at the knights and squires gathered around her.</p>

<p>“There you go.”</p>

<p>“So we are the stationary to them?”</p>

<p>“Master Gran is kind to Johanna.”</p>

<p>I wish he would have shown that mercy to us as well."</p>

<p>Gran scoffed at those who did not hide their dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"Complaints? Self-sacrifice is a knight's true duty."</p>

<p>“Oh, I never thought I'd hear such words from you, Gran.”</p>

<p>Perhaps caught by the knight and his squire, even the taciturn Gran became more talkative at this point.</p>

<p>"Well, you can say whatever you like at this moment. It's a rude word."</p>

<p>“You say ‘rude’, but where's the booze?”</p>

<p>“I don't have any.”</p>

<p>I don't have any. - Ha, I'll hate you.</p>

<p>"You are so right. That's why you don't understand women's feelings and why ladies don't like you.</p>

<p>The civilians call the Imperials war fools, but when it comes to warfare, they are no better than artists.</p>

<p>"Even if you get rid of the god of war, the next one will come crawling out. It is utterly abominable. The burn-faced foreign minister must be enamored. And that one..."</p>

<p>Gran gave up the words he was about to say with a sigh.</p>

<p>"They're here, aren't they? What a motley crew!"</p>

<p>The squire's tone was more awe than contempt. Soldiers were pouring in from the shadows of the roadway. The road is elevated against the lakeshore, and the enemy descending from the high ground has the oppressive sense of momentum. Along the cliffs and through the rain cracks created by erosion, miscellaneous soldiers were pouring out. This was a feat that could not be accomplished by landing from the lakeshore. The slopes have been scoured by precipitation, and have become natural ditches and moat cuttings. Gran had wasted 10,000 gold pieces of time just to crawl his men up to the traffic route. On the flip side, they could just slide down if they didn't even think about retreating.</p>

<p>Wouldn't a circular formation buy us more time?"</p>

<p>"We won't break our flanks. If we let the enemy slip through, they will drop the ice road completely."</p>

<p>A muddy wave of people surged toward the three lines of flankers. The vanguard of each side disappears under the heavy fire of the magic soldiers, but this does not overturn the general situation.</p>

<p>“They are coming, intercept them!”</p>

<p>The two armies intertwined like one living creature. A chaotic chorus, no less than a band, echoed along the shores of the lake. Spears, swords, shields, fists, and all manner of deadly weapons crossed in an attempt to strike down the enemy. Although outnumbered, the qualitative mainstay of the Royal Craist Army, with the Knights of Reharzen at its core, displayed its prowess to the fullest. From the moment their ranks touched down, they knocked down the enemy. But only a few times. The flanks were gradually worn down as if being pecked at.</p>

<p>“They're really uprooting us, aren't they?”</p>

<p>From the top of the slope, the Duke of Myard's army continued to send troops. Supply was not a ready word. As soon as reinforcements arrived from various parts of Rokkou, they were added to the front line, regardless of the type of troops. It could be as few as ten or even several men. The time to think about the battle situation from a bird's eye view of the entire battlefield was gone. The squires and knights who had surrounded him disappeared in front of his blade. They must still be held. The troops had not yet passed through the ice road.</p>

<p>After cutting down two of the miscreants, Gran inhaled and roared.</p>

<p>"My name is Gran!　Knight of Reharzen and head of the Order. Is there not one among you who will lift up my head?"</p>

<p>The few remaining men laugh in resignation at what is about to happen.</p>

<p>"That's him, that's Gran!　If you take him down, the reward will be as you wish, oh-oh-oh!"</p>

<p>“Kill him, the head of the Knight Commander!”</p>

<p>I'll get the head! I'll get the head!</p>

<p>Gran, who was met with all kinds of stares and emotions, answered with his sword. He knocked down a throwing spear in mid-air and crushed the skull of an enemy soldier who had slashed at him from below. For a small army, melee is crippling. Movement is severely restricted in a limited space. It is always an overwhelming individual who breaks through such inconvenience.</p>

<p>"That's not how it's done, Myard!</p>

<p>He has neither the magic to break down walls nor the “skill” to affect a wide area. However, with his swordsmanship honed as a knight of Reharzen and a body strong enough to match it, Gran became a knight commander. He deflected arrows extending from the human wave with his sword spine and reaped earth bullets approaching his chest with his upper body.</p>

<p>“Phew, phew, I'm still with you, I'm still with you.”</p>

<p>Since when did he stop wielding his sword in all his scheming? When did he stop swinging his sword? Was it self-preservation, pride, or position? He would perform the techniques he had learned as he reminisced about his life. He slashes, thrusts, strikes, and strikes.</p>

<p>"Don't cut each other seriously. Surround them, surround them."</p>

<p>“Now, crush them - geez, ah!!!!”</p>

<p>He pokes the eye of a mongrel who tries to assemble himself with his sword. The transparent glass body is crushed, and a slimy thread is drawn. Without wiping it off, he cleaves the approaching group in one lump. The mongrels, their chests ripped open in a single slice, solidify and fall down like ice statues. On the unstable scaffolding where the bodies piled up, the soldier who only cared about the top slipped on what had been his comrade at his feet.</p>

<p>“Phew, phew, hah--”</p>

<p>In contrast, the Knight Commander's movements are undisturbed. On his feet, behind him, he twists around every threat. Even the frivolous Buddha's face was smiling thinly only now. No matter how many words he embellished, the value of a knight's existence lies only in the struggle. Gran has more than fulfilled the meaning of his existence.</p>

<p>Such lionized war efforts were short-lived and popped like a bubble. The catastrophe always came suddenly.</p>

<p>It was a small chance. A sword thrown in desperation struck from the side. A blink of one eye due to a conditioned reflex. A spear pierced his side, cutting through the gap. It was nothing special. It was a mass-produced spear with a few strikes.</p>

<p>"Stabbed!</p>

<p>If it had been in perfect condition, the hardened sheet metal would have prevented the tip of the spear. However, after preventing numerous attacks, the fatigued metal reached its limit.</p>

<p>“Gghh, ugh.”</p>

<p>Without a word of abuse or contempt, Gran lifted his sword silently and snapped the hilt of his spear. At the break, a rush of killing intent rushes in. No one wanted to strike each other due to repeated sacrifices. He thrust the weapon into the distance and threw the armaments lying around him. Still, Gran kept moving. When all the dead bodies of enemies and allies surrounded the immediate area, there was someone who spoke to the leader of the knights.</p>

<p>"You look like you're having a lot of fun, Commander.</p>

<p>“What, you're late.”</p>

<p>It's your fault. When I ran away without a care, I had them carefully surrounded, but you made me go through all that trouble for nothing."</p>

<p>The Highserk who had led the surprise attack from the water said unpleasantly. Without going along with the complaining, Gran asked.</p>

<p>“What happened to the 《Demon Fire》 user?”</p>

<p>"The imperial knights are tired. You are better off with defective products like us."</p>

<p>The history with the imperial knights began with the Battle of Sarajevo. After defeating the three heroes, he assumed that they were after him. He was like a self-conscious clown.</p>

<p>"Yes, don't say that. It's a big deal. You guys are."</p>

<p>"...... I hope that's all you have to say in your last will and testament. Then die."</p>

<p>As if chopping wood, the deadly blade was swung down in a nonchalant manner.</p>

<p>None of the dramatic scenes described in the old knightly tales occurred. There was no honor, no story. With a mere spear, with a mere sword, the Knight Commander was vanquished. No compatriot was there to witness his end, and like a sinner, his head was cut off without a second thought, and Gran died.</p>

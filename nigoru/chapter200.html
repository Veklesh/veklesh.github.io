<p>Episode 46</p>

<p>The shadows of the ears shook in the light of the smoldering embers. The two camps clashing on the Orserica slope fought each other over the cut-through, and the line of defense shifted like the ebb and flow of the tide. The offensive point established by the Ferius Kingdom army swelled and contracted like a person catching his breath. The soldiers were fatigued from the offensive and defense, which was conducted day and night, regardless of the weather. Even in such a battle with no end in sight, there was a break.</p>

<p>When the appointed time arrives, soldiers who have completed their duties leave the battle line in groups or squads. The way they leave, dragging their bodies behind them, reminds me of corporate warriors working overtime. But Walm is just as much a part of the group as the others, and he cannot escape the circle of those who are trying to keep their sanity by reminding themselves of their trivial memories of the past.</p>

<p>“Finally, I can rest.”</p>

<p>“After all that movement, I'm so cold I can't feel my limbs.”</p>

<p>“I can't wait to get back to the fire, I miss that tasty barley porridge.”</p>

<p>After a few days, you get used to the environment, whether you like it or not. The soldiers who had gone down to the plains complained in a whispered voice. As I glanced over, I saw Moyes, who was in charge of leading them, exchanging words with the commander who had taken over at the edge of the horse treadmill. He has become part of the platoon as a platoon leader, although he is still in danger.</p>

<p>“You're doing well, huh?”</p>

<p>He taps his shoulder with the axe spear he carries and breathes away his fatigue. The job is finally done. Although the main Highserk Imperial Army, which is in the rearguard, has not yet arrived at Sarajevo Fortress, some units are ahead of them by naval vessels and are close to entering the Celta Peninsula. The companies of trained soldiers who gained experience in defensive battles are not the combat virgins they used to be. They will be able to withstand the decisive battle between the main field forces and their kinetic battles to a certain extent.</p>

<p>Just as he was about to ponder over which of the six routes would be chosen for the counterattack, the imperial knight shook his head. Rest is part of the job. Now he must devote even a little time to rest. It was too late for dinner and too early for breakfast at dawn. What will the soldiers find for their meal?</p>

<p>Walm's heart was filled with anticipation, but he thought to himself, "I'm sure it will be a mediocre meal anyway. In all likelihood, it would be thin porridge and hard flat bread. The only difference is whether it is cold or warm. Hopefully, it should be hot. If I were to rush out and warm it up personally, I would be envied by the soldiers. Resentment over food is always a terrible thing. It is no joke that barley gruel is a distant cause of death.</p>

<p>The spirit that has been intentionally relaxed leaves the battlefield. A roar in the gut and a rumbling of the earth stopped the imperial knight who was on the verge of such relaxation. Turning around in the heat and shock, dust mixed with vermilion danced on a part of the earth mound. The information that popped into my vision told me the worst signs.</p>

<p>Firepower support before the assault - my intuition, which I should call a rule of thumb based on the countless battlefields I've traversed, rang a bell. Nerves tingled under the skin and blood began to flow like a muddy stream. The body is in a state of excitement and reacts correctly in preparation for battle. Despite his burning body, his thoughts were clear and he returned his whole being to the battlefield.</p>

<p>“Oh, my God, I can't see!”</p>

<p>"Oh, cut!</p>

<p>The battle cry in the night sky was a battle cry to intimidate the enemy and inspire oneself. The sound of the battle cries gave away the direction of the oncoming enemy forces. The breakthrough point was targeted at the border between a company of soldiers and a platoon that had rushed in as reinforcements. Originally separate units, it was easy for discrepancies to arise even when they were in contact with each other. In addition, the impact of the magic concentrated on them would create uncontrollable confusion.</p>

<p>“You were aiming at me!”</p>

<p>The attackers, passing through the gap as if through armor, have established a foothold in the earthworks, and some of them have even entered the horse treads. The attack that had felt so regular up until now, with the appropriate use of force, was now laced with a hint of madness. It was all a deception. The bait of containment at the cut-through had lured the company of paratroopers to the earthen mound.</p>

<p>“Just from the inside of the earthworks, stop them!”</p>

<p>Moyes concentrated on filling in the breakthrough point and forming a second line, avoiding inadvertent intervention in the horse tramp. He had a head start. A half-hearted response would lead to further necrosis. Walm completely surrendered command of his troops and concentrated on his eyes. If the follow-up is not cut off, not only will the hill of Orserica fall, but even its garrison will be lost. It was necessary to crush the followers flowing into the breakthrough point.</p>

<p>The imperial knight, kneaded with magic power and supported by wind-attribute magic, leaped over the inner law with a single step and struck down the axe spear held at the topmost level. The axe head, covered with magical power, shattered the skull of the Ferius soldier who was engrossed in the slash. The deformed helmet rolled away and slashed through the throat of the second man before the threadbare puppet rolled to the ground. Seeing his men sink to the ground, the junior officer, instead of being frightened, whispers sweet venom to the miscreant.</p>

<p>“It's the Demon Fire user!”</p>

<p>"Take them down and make a name for yourself!　I want my reward!</p>

<p>Walm, having received the unwelcome appointment, responds to the instigator. The axe-spear is placed alongside the short spear, which has gained momentum in the run-up, and the axis of the thrust is deflected above his head. Unable to control his momentum. Blood poured from the neck of the militiaman, who had jumped into the branch blade himself.</p>

<p>Before he had time to watch his deathbed, the second ear arced out and reached him from directly above. The spear tip struck the ground, twisting directly downwards. The soldier attempted a second blow, but the imperial knight stepped forward and swung his left fist with index and middle fingers outstretched.</p>

<p>“Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh!!!!”</p>

<p>The blow, which was sucked into the midpoint between the eyebrows, also known as the crow's hare, crushed the eyeball as well as the nasal bone. Ignoring the mutinous soldiers who are flailing about, holding both eyes with a scream, I look behind them. The enemy underlings under his command leap out with a low posture as if they were skunks.</p>

<p>“Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!”</p>

<p>With a breath of air, the sword blade is about to be swung, and its magical power is lit up. The imperial knight, wary of the “hard blow,” belatedly realizes the half-step distance and characteristic sway of the sword. He pulls back his right leg, sinks his back, and moves from intercepting to evading. The underling fired not a “hard blow” but a “wind blade,” and the blade of wind passed through his chest, where he had deflected it. The imperial knight, whose posture had collapsed after dealing with the attack magic, was approached by a follow-up strike from the upper level.</p>

<p>“I got it!”</p>

<p>Walm, who had been hanging down without resistance, stabbed the earthwork with a stone thrust and gained support, and released a kick to the side while falling halfway down. An unexpected counterattack, an attack from outside his consciousness, resonated well with his body. The sole of the shoe that caught him in the torso struck his gut through his armor, forcing him to spit out a breath mixed with saliva.</p>

<p>“Ha, ah, damn you!”</p>

<p>Subordinate Ferius swung his sword, which he had not let go of, in agony, but it stroked the sky in vain. Walm, who had regained his stance in the space he had gained, made a small thrust. The junior officer was able to get past the first and second thrusts with his sword spine, but the third thrust pushed the sword spearhead away and caught the officer in the throat.</p>

<p>From the gaping hole, a bright vermilion color peculiar to arteries gushed out. Walm is not as hungry as the Demon Mask that flails around his waist. He had no interest in the corpse sinking into the blood swamp. He looks out over the battlefield from the edge of the horse treads, supplements what is missing with his imagination, and takes a bird's-eye view of the whole scene.</p>

<p>“No, I can't keep it down.”</p>

<p>The wound would spread if he closed it in one place. A fundamental treatment was needed. In order to find a clue, he shook his head and let his gaze slide. Walm found out who was behind this general attack, and realized the identity of his successor in command.</p>

<p>“So it's them, after all.”</p>

<p>It was the Knights of Reharzen, the Kingdom of Craist's prized violent machine, with its distinctive armor, which I will never forget. Although there were not many squires and knights, a small number of them were probably dispatched to blast the defeated troops. I turned my thoughts away from the hatred that welled up in me. They had been devoured to this extent. Cauterization was urgently needed to stop the bleeding. Walm, who had found an ignition point by avoiding the melee area, was filled with magical power.</p>

<p>He crossed the boundary line of the earthwork, where spears were intermingled, and was about to throw himself into a detour that spread out like an ant's nest. As if in anticipation, a shadow jumped out of the army. Walm quickly fired a fireball and tried to control the path, but his shield, which he had set up on the ground, flew through the air. The fire and projectiles that collided burst into flames, and the flames and debris mingled in mid-air.</p>

<p>“What kind of stupid power is that?”</p>

<p>It is no ordinary person to throw a shielding that takes four or five people to move. Despite his Demon Mask enjoying the attraction, Walm's sense of danger only increased. And his fears were right on target. A rain of flames that would not allow any living creature to survive was twisted around with a bare swing, and the magical membrane of a human being stirred.</p>

<p>“I've seen it! ！！！！”</p>

<p>A familiar, thick voice frowns at me. Walm attacks the one who comes running up the outer side of the mound with the force of an arrow with an axe spear covered with magic power. The man in the opposite direction also lights up his golden club with magic power. The two men bend their reason and slice through the enemy with a powerful blow, and the burst of magical power shakes the air. Walm is thrown off his horse by the impact and recoil and lands on the flat ground, slipping on the inner law.</p>

<p>"Chief Protector!　You!"</p>

<p>“I'm the chief guardian!”</p>

<p>Unable to stop him, the Myard soldiers remaining on the mound leap at the newcomer. The roar of man and iron echoes through the battlefield. Along with the blood mist, an ugly flower of flesh bloomed, and the upper half of the friend soldier's body was literally obliterated. Walm glared at the underling who had done it.</p>

<p>“...... have you followed me here?”</p>

<p>“I've come to settle this once and for all, Knight of Highserk!”</p>

<p>The general, who had been left to rot in the coffin of Fort Eskich, now had a stage to challenge the imperial knights once again.</p>

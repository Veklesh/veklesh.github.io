<p>Episode 17</p>

<p>Just as Walm was beginning to get used to life in the city of Anxio, he received an official request from the Duchy of Myard to come to the castle as the head of the Highserk Imperial Guard. Although he made frequent trips to the castle for medical treatment, his only route was back and forth between the church hall and the barracks. There was no way he could casually stroll around the main building of the ruler of Myard, and he was ignorant of the structure of the main building.</p>

<p>He followed the guide who had visited the church and proceeded through the tightly closed corridor. We checked the thickness of the riveted doors, the height and angle of the arrow chambers, and the presence or absence of the warrior's cover. These are the subjective viewpoints of the attackers, and their eyes naturally move even though they have no intention to search for them. Walm was suffering from a vice that affected his unconsciousness, something that could be called an occupational disease.</p>

<p>Although there were a few regional characteristics, they were within the realm of understanding compared to the mechanisms I had come into contact with during the castle siege and siege. There was nothing particularly new to be seen. The cold stone design of the castle continued on in an unobtrusive manner.</p>

<p>A change came when we turned a corner. Sunlight shone into the gloomy corridor through a combination of windows for lighting. The corridor was dotted with shiny spots, as if inviting. Walm felt as if he were surrounded by light as he walked toward the doorway. Squinting in the glare, he dived through an arch-shaped opening, and his vision opened up at once. It was a garden set up in the courtyard.</p>

<p>In a word, it was vivid. How many people could not take their eyes off of the colorful space? Well-kept trees and blooming plants greet visitors with their sense of sight and smell. I had no intention of pretending to be a cultured person, but the garden spread out before my eyes was beautiful even to the untrained eye, and I had no choice but to admire it with open arms.</p>

<p>“My God.”</p>

<p>As a soldier, I have seen forts and fortresses in northern countries, all of which were built by boiling down the art of castle-building through bloody, actual battles. Habitability and appearance had been discarded. The Highserk think that it is more beneficial to plant a potato than to plant a flower. It is rational to say so. However, there is no soil for culture to flourish there. The Highserk empire has lost, or could not have lost, its richness due to the reality of being under siege.</p>

<p>The ability to enjoy irrational, inefficient, and unnecessary tastes and goods is the proof of a prosperous nation. How much territory has been carved up. How many tens of thousands of armies have they defeated? These must be great war achievements. How much richer is the country and the people because of it? The inner workings of the empire today will naturally answer the question.</p>

<p>“Splendid, isn't it?”</p>

<p>Even Walm, who had received what could be called an inoculation, a previous life, is this upset. The surprise attack of the Duchy of Myard was a great feat.</p>

<p>"Surprising. So far, all the Highserk people who have passed through the gardens have either scowled or looked away. The Lord Protector appreciates them and really enjoys them."</p>

<p>“Highserk also has wildflowers, at least.”</p>

<p>"Wildflowers, I see. To be honest, I am truly surprised that Highserk values flowers and plants more than I do."</p>

<p>Sarcasm. They treat us like barbarians. Exasperated, Walm narrowed his eyes at the man as if in protest. Demon Mask takes advantage of the situation and vibrates violently, as if to make him understand. What a thing to say. After being immersed in battle for so long, his thoughts were being pulled into the Demon Mask.</p>

<p>"Please don't stare at me with your eyes. It makes me tremble."</p>

<p>Half in jest, half in earnest, I suppose. It is both an effect and a harm of the treatment. It's a problem when the demon eye, unconsciously suppressed by pain, appears so easily.</p>

<p>"Please don't misunderstand me. I am happy to connect with the Highserk people not only through sword and fist fellowship, but also through things like appreciation and trade."</p>

<p>Instead of mockery, the man in front of me proclaims that he is truly surprised and pleased. It would be easy to dismiss this as nonsense, but it is no laughing matter in light of what the Empire has done to its homeland. After all, mass exchange meetings with iron weapons and physical language contact are a family tradition, and are the first language of the Highserk empire.</p>

<p>"It's easy to say we don't have enough power - Highserk has neglected everything but the military side. But yes. If the cultural side of things were taught by Myard, the two countries might be able to prosper together for a hundred or two hundred years - just the ravings of a guardian-in-chief."</p>

<p>At first I thought he was just a soldier, but he has a bright point of view, a solid education. Nine times out of ten, he was probably some kind of knight or squire who was also an explorer. The man nodded his head in satisfaction at the reply, and the tour resumed. Walm took one look at the garden and then followed his back. In contrast to the gardens, Walm was now under the most intense guard in the castle.</p>

<p>“Please, they are waiting for you inside.”</p>

<p>A soldier stopped in front of a room and announced to Walm. A door decorated with silverwork is opened, and he steps inside. The eye is caught by the glittering works of art, which are not too overt. The ceiling is so high that the ogre cannot even reach it. In the center of the room sits a long, carved desk that divides the space. A girl and an old man were across such a boundary line.</p>

<p>"I am Walm, chief guardian of the Highserk Imperial Army. It is an honor to meet you. Grand Duke Myard."</p>

<p>He blandly introduced himself as if it were their first meeting, and uttered his name. Rita Myard, the female Grand Duke who now rules the duchy. It was our third encounter. She was still weak, and her eyes were fixed squarely on Walm, unwavering.</p>

<p>He glanced at Latwidge, the elderly knight standing by his side. Two years have passed since the hostilities at the Roundabout, but the light in his eyes has not relaxed, and he has become even more aged.</p>

<p>"I, too, am happy to see you again like this.</p>

<p>He nailed me to the wall, telling me not to fall in love with him. There was a grace and gravitas that only those destined for the top can possess. The innocence of the first time and the danger of the second time were gone as if false. The sorrow of the exile must have been the only deleterious agent that could elevate the girl to the rank of grand duke. What was the purpose for which he had summoned the chief guardian of Highserk? He braced himself for the words to come.</p>

<p>“What I am about to tell you is not about the Grand Duke of Myard, but about Rita Myard personally.”</p>

<p>A kind of precaution. The tense air loosened slightly.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't been ‘missed’ at the first Aidenberg. At least in a city fallen into enemy hands, there would have been no way for me to escape from you, the “Demon Fire” user. Even if it was just a passing fancy or a whim, I still remember that meal I had while on the run."</p>

<p>Perhaps he was related to the nobility. That was the suspicion. But Walm, being driven by personal feelings, pretended not to see it. If he had known at the time that she was the daughter of the previous archduke who had died in battle, would he have let her go?</p>

<p>"The second time was in the bazaar attached to the Sarajevo fortress, wasn't it? They turned on me with murderous intent and azure flames, and to be honest, I was dismayed. It was so caustic that I wondered if it was the same person as that time. I think I have learned the many facets of a person and a country since then. ...... No, I guess it is correct that I am still learning."</p>

<p>He can give mercy to a girl, or he can try to kill her. Is he crazy, full of contradictions? No, it is not. People, including Walm, have many conflicts and contradictions. Conscience, malice, reason, instinct, the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Among them, Walm has been unable to discard the morality he cultivated in his former world and which has nearly worn out in this life, and he has tried to keep the pendulum from swinging too far. He strove to keep the pendulum swinging in the right direction, to maintain his mental balance, to maintain his humanity. In order to dodge reality, he indulged in alcohol and inhaled purple smoke. It is a kind of escapism. I am aware of that much.</p>

<p>"There are very few people who can live with conviction and without contradiction. I envy them and even feel dazzled by them."</p>

<p>I was going to try to keep my face expressionless, but how much could I suppress it? If I had a mirror, I would be able to see the bitterness leaking out, Walm taunted himself.</p>

<p>“...... From here on, I speak as the Grand Duke of Myard.”</p>

<p>The girl breaks off her words and returns to her face as the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>"Just as the friendship of men can be damaged by a trivial event, so easily can friendship between nations be lost. At the time of the League of Four Nations, I was a powerless person, without power or experience. It will be no different now. Nevertheless, I am now firm in my resolve. I will not tolerate anyone who harbors ill will toward the Duchy of Myard, no matter who they are. There have been differences and non-negotiable reasons in both countries. Even now, I have not been able to dispel all of them. Nevertheless, that is why we must prolong this alliance. As an individual and as a military man, I have high expectations of you, Chief Protector Walm."</p>

<p>Walm, whose thoughts were conveyed to him by Rita Myard, both as a public figure and as a private citizen, drops the pretense and returns his true feelings without mending them.</p>

<p>“Whether I want to or not, I am a man who is only capable of destroying and killing.”</p>

<p>The old knight's eyes grow wide, but the archduke restrains him with a hand, saying it is not necessary. Personal preferences and morals aside, the skills Walm has learned on the battlefield are useful and proven.</p>

<p>"I can say, however, that I am good at that. If there is anything that hinders the peace and prosperity of our homeland, or even the peace and prosperity of Highserk and Myard that we share together, we will resist and fight with all our might. Even if I were to lose my eyes and all five of my organs, I sincerely hope that ...... both countries will be able to walk together for a long time."</p>

<p>People wish and resist because they are powerless. Walm was one such person.</p>

<p>Wolm.</p>

<p>"I heard. I heard that you had a meeting with the Grand Duke."</p>

<p>Walm was stopped at a corner of the training ground connected to the barracks.</p>

<p>His voice was full of volume. It was easy to imagine how much energy the man had left in him.</p>

<p>The meeting I know is not with an old knight. Do your couples have such a custom?"</p>

<p>Deborah, one of the key players in the defense of the temporary walls, stands a head taller than a large man and laughs. She is almost middle-aged, but her body is like a walking rock.</p>

<p>"Haha, I didn't have a guardian, but my encounters with my husband were always accompanied by demons.</p>

<p>It's a crazy couple that's going on a date in a demon territory where demons abound. If they were on the battlefield, they would be very reliable.</p>

<p>"I'm relieved. So, are you good with your training, you're missing him?"</p>

<p>I glanced over to see Myard's new recruits piling up in a heap of corpses. They were poor young men who had played with Deborah after having cultivated their physical strength through running. Their faces pallid as if Walm's tip-off had been superfluous.</p>

<p>“There are a lot of guys with cuteness, but not many with backbone.”</p>

<p>Middle-aged people who have aged are inexplicably fond of young people. No doubt they see them carefully rolled over. If you observe these new recruits closely, you will find that some of the more scrupulous ones are playing in the dirt ahead of the rest, deliberately soiling their clothes and pretending to sleep on the ground. I don't know if the head instructor dared to miss it, but Walm pretended not to see it, thinking it would be unwise to go out of his way to mention it.</p>

<p>"I don't have any tension. Walm, how are you doing?"</p>

<p>Distracted, Walm couldn't believe his ears. His finger was pointing in the direction of the training camp. He had no idea that he was being asked out on a date in public, and his quick-tempered Demon Mask was making a fuss.</p>

<p>“It's bad for my husband.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don't mind, do you?”</p>

<p>"You're welcome, Mr. Walm. You're welcome to escort my wife."</p>

<p>Yogim, who is assisting the head minister with a thin face of happiness, agrees. He seems to have some radical principles, endorsing polygamy. Even his son Moyse begins to guide him with a smiling face.</p>

<p>"It's an invitation from an elder. How could I refuse?"</p>

<p>“He's a good man, isn't he?”</p>

<p>Deborah laughs, showing her teeth ferociously. Walm, having given up on the idea, removes his equipment.</p>

<p>“Lord Protector, I'd be happy to help in any way I can.”</p>

<p>Friug's men, who had no idea where they had come from, deftly remove their cuirasses and kneepads and hang them on the chairs. He had to have a talk with the commander of Highserk about how to lead his men. Walm's head was in his hands. In addition, even the new recruits were getting excited as if it were a harvest festival. He knew he should have told them.</p>

<p>"What about the rules? It's going to be hand-to-hand combat, isn't it?"</p>

<p>Walm, who had been stripped and left with only his clothes and half boots, stretched out his arms as he asked the master of the training ground, "If you are back on the ground, you are in a hand-to-hand combat.</p>

<p>“It won't be much fun when our backs are to the ground,” he says.</p>

<p>“I mean...”</p>

<p>“If you make a sound...”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>We agreed with each other. The rest of the meeting was a fun exchange of physical language in the Highserk style. Walm made one suggestion: don't leave yourself open to being beaten.</p>

<p>"It would be a little tasteless without anything to play with, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>“What do you say, we bet on alcohol?”</p>

<p>Walm has turned to a policy of gradual abstinence from alcohol, but he knows that if he refuses, he will get in trouble for not being able to drink my liquor, which will lead to a bad end.</p>

<p>“I'd like that.”</p>

<p>With his willing consent, the bet was made. Slowly, both men take a stance. No need to worry about how to signal the clash. At any rate, we see a father and son holding up a cloth-wrapped hammering spear and breastplate. They seem to be swept away by Deborah and are enjoying life quite a bit. I wonder if they would survive in Dandurg if they didn't.</p>

<p>The cheers of the soldiers adorn the drill hall, their controlled stomping and clapping of hands. A gruff gong is rung in full force. The dance is either a passionate tango or a breathtaking flamenco. Either way, the curtain rose on a stage where those who danced too late were forced to prostrate themselves on the ground.</p>

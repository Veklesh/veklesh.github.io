<p>Episode 49</p>

<p>On this gruesome battlefield, Rattu, the defender of Fort Eskish, smiled at the imperial knight. It was a carefree smile, as if he were comparing drinks with an old friend at a bar. If he is bluffing, he is a great actor, but if he is sincere, he has natural talent. Walm, for example, is forced to show his teeth in front of his soldiers, as if to say, "Smile only when you are in distress. I envied him his sensitivity to warfare.</p>

<p>His reason as a soldier cries out for him to abandon his silly sentimentality. In times of trouble, think simply. Only defeat the fierce general in front of you. The imperial knight, wearing a mask to cover his emotions, declared.</p>

<p>“The old tree that wants to die will send you to the underworld as you wish.”</p>

<p>“I've been waiting for those words!”</p>

<p>Walm slashed at Ratu, who happily responded to his confession of murderous intent, with his uppermost slash. The two clashed with a “hard blow” that bent logic, and the magical power they were charged with went wild as they tried to devour each other. The two aim to cut off the fifth finger, but despite its appearance, the rugged metal hammer moves with great delicacy. He pushes away the branch blade that is close at hand and turns to counterattack. The difference in physique between him and the old general with his huge frame is remarkable. The thrust, a mixture of thrusts and blows, is equivalent to a strike down.</p>

<p>"Shhhh, shhhh!</p>

<p>Walm rapidly tilted his posture to the left as he assessed the trajectory of the approaching golden crushing stick with a shout. His left shoulder was thrust out, and his body, which had been facing forward, became a half body. As if tracing a shadow, the gold bar was swung. Even though it was a blow without any waist, it had enough mass and impact to check him.</p>

<p>Walm slides the handle of his axe-spear and changes his grip to the extreme tip, stepping forward without hesitation. His posture sinks so low that the ground feels familiar. The tack-painted tip snatches at the surface. The demon is not angry, but rather thrilled to enjoy the thrill ride.</p>

<p>The neck is distant and alert. It is not an opponent that can be killed with a single blow. The axe head strikes the back of the knee like a hatchet. The response he got made the imperial knight realize he had failed. Ratu did not take evasive action, but turned the shaft of his leg and caught it with his shin splints.</p>

<p>“Hhhhhhhh, nnnnghhh!”</p>

<p>The echoing dull pain was just bearable as he let out a cry, and Walm, trying to regroup, released a stab and tried to disengage. The thrust, which once again scattered up and down, was blocked by the hilt.</p>

<p>The avalanche of men is reflected in his eyes as he thrusts out his axe spear and searches for a gap. Part of the platoon that had switched places with Moyes's squad had streamed in, slashing at the enemy. Ratu was no exception. Myard's men, who had narrowly cut down the enemy, took aim at the old general from behind. Honorable single combat is nothing in this war-torn world. There is no hesitation. Walm, too, improvises and fires a small thrust in response to the surprise attack.</p>

<p>“Giiiiiight--”</p>

<p>Ratu, realizing the surprise attack behind him, turned around and reaped the gold crushing stick. Not just the sword, but his upper body popped like a balloon. The spear tip was close to his neck as the blood mist of his pathetic friend rained down on him. Walm was convinced that he had won, but the old tree spun like a spinning top.</p>

<p>The centrifugal force of the golden rod made the old general's profile spinning. One eye, out of the corner of his eye, was staring at him. The moment the ear bit into his skin, he felt a shock as his whole arm was deflected away from him. It was a great trick. He swung the gold-crushed stick with his back completely against Walm, albeit temporarily, and struck the spearhead with the handle.</p>

<p>“Now that was a chilling moment.”</p>

<p>“Don't talk nonsense to me.”</p>

<p>Rattu declared, as he smashed down a new Myard soldier who was trying to cut him down with his metal club. That's not even a weak sound. Even though they were outnumbered, no one in the rest of the reinforcement platoon, who had seen the two men die so tragically, would have attacked the old general.</p>

<p>"Help Ratu-sama, take out the imperial knights!</p>

<p>a junior officer, who was also at Fort Eskish, shouted from the top of the earthwork.</p>

<p>“...... Rodrigue!”</p>

<p>"It's a battlefield, it's a battlefield. One against many is no cowardice."</p>

<p>The old general neither denied nor affirmed any more. The inspired militia tried to spear the imperial knights. Two soldiers tried to get around the rear, two lined up against Ratu. Neither observation nor stagnation would hasten their deaths. The first move is the only way to seize the initiative.</p>

<p>Without warning, Walm leaps to the flank, grips a stone thrust, and swings his spear. The neck of the Craist soldier, who had thought he was out of range, was split open. The soldier was too late, as the comrade following behind him let a red rose bloom from his throat and stiffened himself. He twirled the branch blade around his unprotected shoulder and pulled it to his hand. The soldier screams as he is pulled back, his shoulder blades shredded. He grabbed his neck as he let go of the axe spear in his embrace and kicked and folded his knee from the side, showing it off.</p>

<p>“You're killing me!”</p>

<p>The Yarukkuk follower of Ratu from Fort Eskish, even the loss of half of his limbs does not diminish his spirit. They are not wasting their lives trying to avenge the loss of half of their limbs. Rattu, on the other hand, was taking his army with him and was looking for a way to settle the score. But Walm survived the melee, and became a light infantryman. He has mastered the vicious methods of taking on the multitude.</p>

<p>“He's a big guy.”</p>

<p>“Ha, ah--ah!”</p>

<p>A murmur in a tone of voice that could have been either flattery or penitence became the soldier's last words heard. Walm transforms the magic he kneaded on the wounded soldier's back into a dazzling blue flame.</p>

<p>The soldier's body was literally shattered when he was hit by the fireball at zero distance. The blue flames exposed the dawn and revealed the devastation of the earthworks. I stared at the front through a break in the flames. Explosions and human debris rained down, and the Craist soldiers who stepped into close proximity lay as if their threads had been broken. A shadow stirs between them. The strong magical membrane could withstand even "Demon Fire. They would not die at this level.</p>

<p>"Rodriguez, leave me alone. You guys concentrate on the right wing and take out the commander. If you drive them back with numbers, they will only die."</p>

<p>“...... please, let us win.”</p>

<p>Rattu ordered with a straight face, his face filled with a sense of intimidation. Although his inner conflict was evident in his expression, the non-commissioned officer called Rodriguez disappeared to the left flank, where Moyes was in charge.</p>

<p>"In this intricate war situation, it is the order given by the deputy commander of Reharzen to suppress the imperial knights. You can't use “Demon Fire” in this situation, even if you can retreat for a time, you will burn the entire garrison."</p>

<p>“Is that why you are stalling?”</p>

<p>In addition to his powerful attack, he has a thick magical membrane and extraordinary physical abilities. It was not easy to break him down if he was on the receiving end. Walm defeated the old man and rescued his company. He had no time for idle chitchat with the old man.</p>

<p>"Well, listen, ...... I've learned a lot of things, all of which came at a painful cost. You have quenched the fire of longing that swelled against my old age. I am fighting on the battlefield with all that I have accumulated. But now, at my age, I realize. It seems that I am a little greedy. I want to exceed the imperial knight. Do you laugh at my foolishness?"</p>

<p>Is this a statement of the heart or a renewed declaration of war? He is old and worn out, but his energy has not waned in the slightest.</p>

<p>“It's neither a battle situation nor an opponent that can be laughed off.”</p>

<p>Instead of the axe spear, which he had already shown many times, he pulled out the longsword on his waist. The imperial knight pours magic power into the sword and lights a blue flame on the blade.</p>

<p>“Ha ha ha, I didn't know you still had a trump card!”</p>

<p>“As a gift, I will light your way to the underworld.”</p>

<p>“I don't need your help!”</p>

<p>Carelessly, boldly, the two men engaged in combat. Their interests were not aligned. The circumstances and convictions of each of them made them hasten to settle their differences. The two men's respective circumstances and convictions hastened them to a decision. When the golden club pushed away the iron armor and struck a blow, the flaming sword cut the old general's flank. In the midst of the melee, the two men fighting to the death seemed to have a lot of openings.</p>

<p>Soldiers who committed inviolability and the perfect opportunity to influence the war situation. Walm burns Craist's soldiers in one hand, and Ratu also reaves Myard's soldiers with an iron block as if it is too much trouble. Even the interruption is a sideshow, and the sword fights intensify as the spears are incorporated into the mortal combat.</p>

<p>The sound of swords and metal clubs rubbing against each other echoes. The sound of the swords and the metal clubs rubbing against each other and the sound of wear and tear echoes in the air, the result of the slash-and-burn battle, and although irregular, it lingers in the ears like a sound. The offensive beats are quickened, and the strength of the beats created by the receiving and passing of the sword produces a variety of sounds. It was a battlefield instrument.</p>

<p>It does not last forever. When they separated, their bodies collided with each other, creating a distance. There was no need for them to watch each other. They secured a deadly pause between each other. When they pointed the tip of the sword at each other with a flickering blue flame, the massive metal crushing stick dominated overhead. The countless scars and wounds that have been carved by training and actual battle weigh heavily on Walm. There is no basis for this. However, the rule of thumb cultivated on the battlefield whispers to him that the next move will settle the matter. Both men stepped into each other's upper stance and delivered a killing blow.</p>

<p>The tips of their swords clashed, drawing azure trails. The response was bone-numbing, but there was no clash of swords as there had been in the past.</p>

<p>"What?</p>

<p>Ratu's face contorted at the light, clear metallic sound, an unusual sound that was not possible with the previous collisions. The sword does not scrape through. Yet it can still slash.</p>

<p>The repeated slashes, and the golden crushing stick that had been with the old general for decades, were also not unaffected by old age. The blade of the sword, cut off at the damaged tip, scrapes through the metal rod. Breaking through the armor and the magical membrane, the longsword burned through Ratu's collarbone and hipbone. Blood pours out of the fallen old general without stopping. It was a fatal wound that even Ayane could not save him from.</p>

<p>“Did you take the horns?”</p>

<p>The imperial knight silently stared at the old general sinking to the ground. His consciousness was already fading and he was not sure of his current state of awareness.</p>

<p>"Sorry, Rourougu, I lost. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Horns, I also learned, next time, prevent, fuhaha, ah."</p>

<p>“...... Oh, next time, it will be prevented.”</p>

<p>Without answering a word, the old general passed away with a smile on his face. He had killed many men, but he had never seen anyone die laughing on the battlefield. On the other hand, Demon Mask, having been entertained by the play from a special seat, clenched his face sweetly in place of applause and sipped the return blood. It was indeed a cursed mask, as the former squad members had feared.</p>

<p>The big picture was not yet decided. Outnumbered, Craist's Royal Army still held the upper hand. But the death of the old general was not light. In addition to the confusion of the Yarkuk soldiers under their command, Craist's soldiers, who had witnessed the fierce battle to the death, had certain doubts. Who would be able to defeat the imperial knights and who would be able to slay each other on this Orzelika slope? Half a minute after the death of the old general, the battle on Orzelica Hill, which included a huge number of dead, came to an end at sunrise.</p>

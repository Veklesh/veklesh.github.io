<p>Episode 52.</p>

<p>“Are you sure it's true or not misinformation!”</p>

<p>"It's information from many sources. False alarms are highly improbable."</p>

<p>Enemy forces have landed along the rocky coast behind Cape Raga. The urgent news sent shock waves through the Duchy of Myard's senior officials in the floating city of Ancushio. Bewilderment was a simple thing. Their thinking, which had been drained by the daily battles, was completely shaken by the shock of Celta's landing.</p>

<p>"What was the navy doing, allowing the main force of the enemy, including the Knights of Reharzen?</p>

<p>"Although early detection was not achieved, the patrol ships sacrificed themselves to warn the enemy. It must be the problem of the land forces that failed to destroy the landing point."</p>

<p>"We are devoting most of our forces to Rokkou!　We can't possibly place troops along the entire length of the lakeshore."</p>

<p>What's the reserve force for?</p>

<p>"We are prepared for an invasion from the Six Mouths of Celebes. They were not supposed to cross the frozen lake.</p>

<p>Even the Grand Duchess Rita Myard was thinking of a counter-offensive and a decisive battle against the Six Mouths of Celebes. A reserve force, what a sweet word to hear. In reality, however, the basic premise of the defense plan has collapsed, and a dagger is about to be placed at its throat. If only one of the six points had been pulled out, those who were accustomed to being outnumbered would have been able to respond with solemnity. The bias in troop operations and deployment was the result of sitting on naval forces and key points and losing flexibility.</p>

<p>“What about the rear treatment station set up behind Cape Raga?”</p>

<p>“We've sent a liaison officer, but I'm not sure if we'll be able to evacuate in time.”</p>

<p>"It's the key to the succession of battles!　The key to the continuation of the war!</p>

<p>"How can we do that?　We don't have enough troops or time. The troops at Cape Raga are struggling to hold the fort. If you divide your troops badly, you will give the enemy a new route to march."</p>

<p>“What about the Highserk Imperial Army's advance force, if not the main army?”</p>

<p>"We are still on the water. We are still on the water. If we think about landing, we will never make it in time.</p>

<p>In the face of the impossibility of the situation, emotional and impulsive discussions were exchanged. It would be better to call it a passionate exchange of opinions. After waiting for the chief ministers to finish their information and emotions, Rita briefly asked, "What is the best way to counterattack?</p>

<p>"We cannot hope for an immediate counterattack. That's right."</p>

<p>"Regrettably, it is impossible. In addition to the movement of reserve forces, we will have to extract forces from the other six mouths."</p>

<p>One of the military officers uttered the consensus with a face filled with bitterness. All of the units that confronted him halfway were in the midst of a breakout run. The Royal Army of Craist is determined to end it all before the main relief force of the Highserk Imperial Army arrives.</p>

<p>“In order to do so, it is essential to stall for time.”</p>

<p>At this point, the landing site is very difficult to defend. In short, they needed a rock to dam the muddy waters of the army. And that was against the main force, including the Knights of Reharzen.</p>

<p>“In order to counterattack, we need to draw a second line behind Fort Raga on the assumption that it will be breached.”</p>

<p>“What local forces are available to respond immediately?”</p>

<p>What's the local force that could respond immediately?</p>

<p>The only force we have in numbers is a company of the Highserk Imperial Guard stationed in the area."</p>

<p>Instead of the bristling military officer, a man answered Rita.</p>

<p>“Brigadier Justus, are you sure about that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Friug's company, which has been replenished and treated, is in the rear of Fort Raga, awaiting orders.”</p>

<p>It was a force to be desired. However, the reluctance of the soldiers gathered at the war council only increased. The force was too small for the enemy forces that had been allowed to land. Once they were deployed, their fate was more obvious than seeing fire. Even though they were former enemies, the Highserk were now friends. The sensible military officer Myard pessimistically denies it.</p>

<p>"Mister Justus, are you insane?　You're up against thousands of men with the standing army of the Kingdom of Craist at their core."</p>

<p>"Even if you add the defeated soldiers and small units in the vicinity to that company, it won't even reach a thousand. Every last one of them will die."</p>

<p>The oldest, Rutwidge, rebuked these young military officers.</p>

<p>"...... I'm sure you are well aware of that, Justus-dono. That is why. If we sit back and watch, certain defeat awaits us. Even if you make the best move at the end of the debate, it will be a bad idea after a time. Now that the initiative has been seized, the fastest move is necessary. Even if it is ruthless."</p>

<p>The words had the weight of an old man. The eyes of those gathered in the military council hall turned to Rita. As the leader of the Duchy of Myard, she needed to make a decision. She tried to keep her voice flat so that they would not realize her inner conflict.</p>

<p>“Can you order them to defend themselves to the death?”</p>

<p>"Friug's company is an old strongman who fought at that Dandurg. They may be by far the smallest of the smallest of the small, but they will do what is necessary for Myard and Highserk if they are ordered to do so. Even if their limbs are shredded or their eyes are crushed. Is that what you want, Rita-sama?"</p>

<p>The way he says it is laced with accusation. But that is not the essence of the words. He is asking the people present here and Rita about their resolve. If they are to be the cornerstone of both countries, they must not die in vain.</p>

<p>"...... Rita Myard would like that. Order them in my name and the Highserk Empire in tandem."</p>

<p>"I order them to defend the place to the death until the arrival of our friends. Good day."</p>

<p>With these words, Brigadier Justus left the large room in a nonchalant manner. The Hyserges are a people with no sense of politics, no bargaining through diplomacy, and no culture that has taken root in their soil. That is the Highserk people. They have boiled down their roots to an empire through the destruction and annexation of small countries and city units.</p>

<p>They are a totalitarian people that stands out even among the northern nations, and they have a terrible disregard for the individual. They are terribly obedient to orders given by the community. Once they have made up their minds, they have done so no matter how inhumane or vile it may be. The harsh environment has shaped their national character. It is now both dependable and terribly frightening.</p>

<p>"Even though we have allowed them to surprise us, the line of communication is an unstable frozen lake surface. We still have a chance to win if we don't let them step inland. With our reserve forces and the forces extracted from each of the six ports, we will smash the enemy's bridgehead and cut off their rear. At this time, turn the Celta Peninsula into a decisive battlefield against them."</p>

<p>"The Grand Duke of Myard has given us an order. First, the numbers. Gather as many as you can, as many as you can."</p>

<p>The strategy was set. All that remained was to support those fighting on the front lines. He lacks military strategy and does not have the charisma to make people go crazy. That is why he has to digest what his vassals say, swallow it, and make consistent decisions. That is what is required of a grand duke today.</p>

<p>“...... I wonder if your father, who took the scorched earth strategy, felt the same way.”</p>

<p>As a father, I respect him. And as a Grand Duke, I will not make the same mistake as Youth Myard, who will be my antagonist. Rita murmurs quietly amidst the hustle and bustle of the people.</p>

<p>"Hey, Ratwidge. I wondered if this was the right thing to do. I'm sending them to their deaths."</p>

<p>Rita shuddered at her own shallowness. Far from the ideal ruler. Once he had given his orders. If they indecisively questioned the decision, what would the soldiers they were ordered to fight based on, what would they believe? It is a betrayal of the people. The old knight neither consoled nor scolded them for the ugly truth they had exposed.</p>

<p>"I am the main culprit of this atrocity. I lacked strength and wisdom, and I admonished him to put his trust in his neighbors for the fate of his country. If I could at least stand shoulder to shoulder with them on the battlefield,...... no matter how many words I embellish in the rear, I will only add to my shame."</p>

<p>Ratwidge, called an old hand, was also a man. He stopped licking his master's wounds and looked through a window inset in the stone wall. Normally, the surface of the lake would glow blue in the morning sun. But to the now sentimental Rita, it looked sticky, dark and stagnant.</p>

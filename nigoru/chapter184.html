<p>Episode 31 The Grand Duchess</p>

<p>The Celta Peninsula juts out like a sharp sword into a huge lake. At the base of the peninsula are a series of horseshoe-shaped mountains and cliffs. Except for a few cutouts at the entrance to the peninsula, the only way to cross the peninsula is either over the steep mountains or across the lake. The outer walls of the city blocked out any threats from the outside. It brought stable governance to the military port city of Ancusio, which included a good port, and functioned as the core of the Duchy of Myard in both name and reality since the fall of the capital, Eidensberg.</p>

<p>The Ferius region was one of the few areas that escaped direct damage after the Great Outbreak, and it was inevitable that those who survived would gather there. In this unprecedented crisis, Rita Myard, the grand duchess of the Duchy of Myard, the ruler, rallied the surrounding lords, churches, and refugees with her unspoken and unquestioning leadership.</p>

<p>There can be more than one thinking head. But there must be only one head that makes decisions. Rita is aware that she was authoritarian. However, if she had not done so, she would not have been able to resist the demons that roamed the land and the approaching hunger. Rita's days were filled with fishing and water transportation to feed her people and to use the land as a base for counter-demons to scrape away the land that had fallen into human hands.</p>

<p>He read through all the reports and petitions that came in from all over the country and made a decision in Myard's name. Due to chronic fatigue, her eye holes are hollowed out and dark circles decorate the edges of her eyes like makeup. It was a flaw in a woman's appearance, but it gave her eyes a sharpness and saved her from being a bit of a foil as a ruler. As Grand Duke, Rita did what she could. But not everything went well. The lack of means of transportation and manpower resulted in shortages of food and fuel and uneven distribution, and she was unable to prevent people from starving or freezing to death. Some villages were crushed by the return of the demons, as were the people who had settled back into their homelands.</p>

<p>Rita Myard's rule was neither perfect nor equal. To her victims, she must have seemed like a petulant girl who lacked the qualities of a grand duke and was ignorant of the realities of the world. But if they had stuck to the details, the whole thing would have collapsed, and they would have simply pushed the refugees into the demon territory with crude sticks and farming implements.</p>

<p>Two years have passed since then. Not everyone has died of starvation or freezing to death. Even so, the situation was gradually improving, thanks to the full-scale operation of the Refun Mine and the trade network through the Highserk Empire. The situation was improving little by little, as people could relax their cheeks at the petty amusements among their vassals, and even consider the surface of Lake Celta, which had been a mere scenery, to be beautiful.</p>

<p>The surface of the lake, which had been calm until yesterday, was disturbed by countless wake waves. This was the result of the fleet anchored in the bay, sailing out in preparation for enemy ships. Disturbances also occur on land. Armor stored in warehouses was pulled out by the roots, and the collection of soldiers from among the people continued.</p>

<p>"The protection of the people of King Ferius, who suffer from oppression. The liberation of territories that were unjustly annexed, and that too with the emblem of the royal house of Ferius."</p>

<p>“Did the royal house of Ferius really survive?”</p>

<p>"Impossible. The former Kingsguard reported that the Fellius royal family died with the country in the royal castle. Either they were so far apart in blood that they could not even be mentioned in the family tree, or they were created. After establishing a puppet state, it could be a satellite state, annexed, whatever you want."</p>

<p>At the far end of the citadel, glaring over the city, were gathered the chief ministers who would determine the national policy of Ancusio and, by extension, the Duchy of Myard. The hall, where platoons of soldiers were lined up, was heated with endless debate, but the secrecy of the room made it impossible to let the outside air in. The subjects of the discussions were at a standstill.</p>

<p>"In the first place, what is this ultimatum? The war has already begun.</p>

<p>"Surprise is the basis of warfare. We are the ones who failed to do so."</p>

<p>"The location of the uprising is Balboaad and Lanaisfear, near the provisional border. The Royal Army of Craist has already advanced there.</p>

<p>The uprising is in fact a private army of the Royal Army of Craist, which has been buried in the city!</p>

<p>“The axis of attack is along the lakeshore, as expected, but the Yarkuk uprising and the break in the lines of communication have left the garrison in Refun unable to move.”</p>

<p>"Literally a cutting of the road. The local garrison is an island on land."</p>

<p>The military officers frown as they lay their pieces on the map. Their inconsistent movements pointed Rita to the confusion of information coming from the field.</p>

<p>"In Yarukuk and Barbasuek, the lords have all turned on each other. Ungrateful bastards."</p>

<p>"These are the same people who complained about the preferential treatment of Refun and other areas. They should have been picked off without any tax relief. In fact, they had enough power to rebel."</p>

<p>“I'm not being sarcastic.”</p>

<p>“It would have been negligent of the military to let them eat away at the provisional border, let alone inland.”</p>

<p>The military officer barked at him, as if he were trying to lay the blame on him.</p>

<p>"Easy for you to say, it's all theoretical. Where was the time to be selective in a national crisis!　Are you asking us to inspect cargo and people from one end to the other? If the transport had been delayed, thousands of additional people would have starved, frozen, and died."</p>

<p>The defender was the head of a merchant family that covers all logistics from shipping to land transport in Celta.</p>

<p>"I'm not saying they are all responsible, but they are not to blame. The flow of people is the blood of the country. If we stop it, what awaits us is necrosis of the edges. In the first place, against Myard and Highserk, which were the main battlegrounds in the last war, Craist and Liberitoa, whose home countries are intact, have a lot of moves they can take. The flow and number of people are directly related to information. It's not too late to be at a disadvantage in intelligence."</p>

<p>“If we had at least one more year, we would have had a little extra strength and ...... would have been able to find out more.”</p>

<p>The civilian officer mumbled emphatically, shaking his head and dropping his eyes.</p>

<p>"It was necessary for the governance of the old Ferius territory. Even if it was poisoned."</p>

<p>"They demanded the immediate return of the former Ferius territory, including Refun. The removal of the Highserk imperial army and the stationing of allied troops in Celta."</p>

<p>“Nonsense, there is no such thing as sovereignty!”</p>

<p>“It's easy to refuse, but if the nation is destroyed, the original will be lost. ......”</p>

<p>Craist used to be an army of knights and heroes, but now we have several battalions of soldiers.</p>

<p>“They are the result of natural selection, the result of the assault on the demon territory by the Felians living from the northwest to the east with the mission of recapturing their homeland.”</p>

<p>One of the civilian officials said enviously, though he avoided stating it explicitly.</p>

<p>"If we pay no attention to human losses, we can reduce the number of mouths to feed, and we don't have to pay for training soldiers. If you're on the front lines, there's no fear of being caught red-handed in a mutiny. ......</p>

<p>The opposite of Myard's national policy. Rita, however, was not so innocent as to criticize. She did not take in the Felians just for the sake of cleanliness. The Duchy of Myard had lost too many people due to the prolonged warfare. There was a need to bring in new flesh and blood and a new population in order to continue the nation.</p>

<p>“What about our reply to the Kingdom of Craist?”</p>

<p>There was no clear answer to the question of the civilian overlords. Only a spate of pessimistic opinions based on reality. The exhausted vassals' discussions ceased, and silence dominated the scene. But their eyes spoke eloquently to Rita. What to do about the demands of that country? It was a turning point. The fate of the Principality would be decided here. Without hesitation, Rita told the shaken people</p>

<p>"Let's say we give up the former Fellius territory and the Lehun mines. Then, next. Remove the barrier?　Rip up the fort?　Moats, walls, whatever, the demands escalate without stopping. We are underestimated as easy to eat. If we back down now, we will be extorted forever. There can be no compromise."</p>

<p>What was told was a thorough fight. The assembled men chose their words carefully and proposed to their Lord.</p>

<p>“Grand Duke, considering the future of diplomacy, it is too much .......”</p>

<p>"Considering the difference in forces, we are outnumbered. Besides, after clashing with the allied forces, there is a danger of another turnover."</p>

<p>“Yarkuk, have there been any defections among the former Ferius lords other than Barbas Ek?”</p>

<p>Rita asks the military officer who was reflecting the reports from the communication grimoire on the map, one after the other. The word that came back was a denial.</p>

<p>“No, I haven't confirmed yet.”</p>

<p>"Some lords may feel indebted to you for rescuing them from the Great Outbreak. But you can't live on ingratitude alone. The seceded lords made that choice with the prosperity of their people and their families at stake. Then what of the rest?"</p>

<p>The round table is silent, waiting for the Grand Duke to speak next. Slowly, Rita cast her eyes on each and every one of them.</p>

<p>"In fact, I think he doubts it. I wonder if the Kingdom of Craist will be able to drop the Celta peninsula. The Highserk empire has surrounded Celta, but has given up the attack by force. Highserk is now a friend. The empire was defeated by the four allied armies. Can Craist capture Celta, which the Empire could not defeat?　They were defeated in Lehun and in Sarajevo - you will remember them."</p>

<p>It is hard to let bygones be bygones. It was even harder to let bygones be bygones if it was a horrific battle. That is why the threat and fear of Highserk's imperial army remains deep in our memories. Even the chief ministers present were no exception. Even Rita was not an exception. When she met the elite of Highserk, especially the “Demon Fire” wielders who manipulated blue flames, she felt both gratitude and awe at the same time in her heart. Only the old knight standing by his side was aware of this.</p>

<p>“That Highserk will do everything in his power to save us?”</p>

<p>After all, they are old enemies, and the military officer sounds the alarm from a different perspective. Even those who have trained and acted together still have doubts. Friendship and trust between nations - very well. It is a beautiful word to unite the people. However, those who know the reality are not fooled by such cheap words. Rita assured them in a very cold manner.</p>

<p>"Highserk will serve Myard even if it costs them their lives. If we fall, sooner or later Highserk will be crushed from the east and west."</p>

<p>Pang, a dry sound echoed. Rita clapped her hands together vigorously, suggesting the consequences for the empire that refused to come to the rescue at all costs. This was why she had not invited the Highserk camp to the meeting. After gathering enough eyes, Rita twisted her crossed hands and intertwined her fingers.</p>

<p>"They need us. And vice versa. The two countries already have a deep-seated dependence on each other. Militarily and economically."</p>

<p>It is that cooperative relationship that my father, Euse Myard, erred. If we are condescending and reluctant to provide support to the Kingdom of Ferius, we will pander to the Highserk Empire and attack them. He should have blackmailed them gently and politely, and then done everything in his power to draw their support. We cannot make the same mistake. Myard must show Rita its usefulness.</p>

<p>“Any other opinions?”</p>

<p>No one spoke a word of denial or shook his head in the face of the resolute Grand Duke. The Craist kingdom's move was an excellent one. The seizure of the provisional border line, the division of forces, they functioned as a mental shake-up in addition to military superiority. That is why, as leaders, we must set a policy.</p>

<p>"We will fight a decisive battle in the field as soon as the rearguard of the Highserk imperial army arrives and defeat the Craist Liberitoa allied forces. Do you still speak on the assumption that we will lose?"</p>

<p>Rita's stern expression relaxed as she continued, and she gave the order to the civilian officials.</p>

<p>"Tell the messenger, politely, that We are preparing for a grand burial at Lake Celta. Therefore, there will be no need for provisions on the return journey. We look forward to the arrival of your army."</p>

<p>"Ha, that's a bold move, isn't it?</p>

<p>“Let's teach them a lesson in emotion.”</p>

<p>The way the Grand Duke said that, even though it was small, it brought a laugh from the heavyweights. It is necessary to laugh hard because we are in a tight spot. It was a fitting response to the jokey ultimatum.</p>

<p>Episode 18</p>

<p>The clenched fist held in front of the chest is scraped away and spreads to fill the field of vision as if it had grown huge. Walm, using his dynamic vision, folded his upper body and shifted the line of his head. The air pushed out by the swing shook his hair like a light breeze.</p>

<p>“Your hands, you're so fast!”</p>

<p>The strike, which was released without using the hips to relax, was a blow that placed speed at its highest priority. Originally, it was a blow used as a check, but it was not such a gentle one. If you get hit in the face, you will be forced to turn your back and spray saliva. The careful greeting continued.</p>

<p>"I don't like to be rushed and I don't like to be rushed!</p>

<p>A hard blow comes in to replace the left that was pulled back. If you receive a serious blow from a step in, your body may float in the void. Walm, who gave priority to evasion by lowering the bottom of his foot to scrape the bottom of his foot, was struck in the void, and the head instructor never stopped smiling. Rather, he made physical contact with the momentum as it was. At first glance, it was a simple physical contact, but in reality, it was an advanced technique that also served as a crushing blow. He was crushed by the distance and some of the options.</p>

<p>“You are very passionate.”</p>

<p>It was only because of the skin contact that I could read their different physiques. Walm is not so much Han or foolish as to indulge in a shoving match with a large tree with roots. He pulls his shoulders back and slides his feet to the side before he is completely thrown off balance. If he can't catch the center of gravity, he can still pass it off. As Walm flanks her, Deborah tries to turn her around on one foot. Her nimbleness, which did not match her huge body, was like a wild dance.</p>

<p>Before her opponent could turn to face her, Walm thrust her fist into her side, and her face contorted at the feel of it. It was not the familiar response of hitting a leather bag filled with sand, but a shock and a dull pain as if he had hit a marble with his bare hands.</p>

<p>“Oooh, that's a person's side?”</p>

<p>“You did it!”</p>

<p>He tries to pursue, but the half-boots close in with a trajectory that seems to crawl on the ground. It was no longer a kick, but a foot swipe. When he jumped back, a line of kick passed through the place where his shin had been. First of all, the goal is to block mobility, right? A foot mowing like that is no joke.</p>

<p>“Phew.”</p>

<p>Walm moves his upper body in a rhythm with his feet, swaying finely. The distance opens and a fist is unleashed. A blow with a flexed elbow and wrist is hard to discern its origin. He slams it down with a half-open hand, and slides his elbow through the approaching second blow. He dives into the pocket and strikes again, this time to the side of the head. His body stiffens as if numb from being struck in the liver, but his anger swells absurdly.</p>

<p>A sharp pointy edge extends out of the corner of his eye, as if it is rising up in the corner of his vision. A knee kick aimed at the chest, which could have shattered his ribs if he had taken it. Walm deflected his upper body to avoid it, but a flickering shadow made him realize that even this was a diversion. He was guided to the lower level, and his main goal was a hard right hand. Despite his appearance, he was quite a good performer.</p>

<p>He traced with his eyes the hard strike that extended like a spear, and avoided it just before the collision. He took advantage of the opportunity created by the large swing and was about to counterattack without hesitation. Walm's vision wavered, and he felt a dull pain on his cheek. The blood seeping from the cut in his mouth told him what had happened.</p>

<p>I can't handle it. As if in response to the strike down, a fist was released and tried to penetrate into the torso. He flexibly softened the impact by catching it with both hands, but suddenly felt a floating sensation. Literally levitated, Walm lands with a flourish, scattering dust. His palms go numb as if electrified.</p>

<p>“Oof.”</p>

<p>“Ha, good eyesight is a good thing to think about.”</p>

<p>Deborah opens and closes her fists, which are folded at the tips of her fingers, as if to show a trick. A cat's paw. This is what happens when you make a hasty next move. He almost avoided it, but then his fist loosened and he was hit. Whether he was lured in or it was a reflex, either way, he was very skillful. Walm, having spat out the blood that had accumulated in his mouth, looked at the head instructor in front of him.</p>

<p>“I wanted to get that eye once, you know!!!!”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Walm, having correctly received the head instructor's request, dives head-on. He exchanges blows left, right, and left, handling blows with his shoulders and elbows. His abdominal muscles were so strong that his fists were reduced four or five times, and finally a breath escaped from his mouth. Even so, they did not stop moving, and the exchange of blows became more and more intense.</p>

<p>A backhand blow like a cleave was met with a kick to the side of the shin. As the fighters re-positioned their upper bodies, the first strike of the day came at them. Walm stepped forward without taking evasive action against the pressure of the fist, which felt as if it were coming from directly above him. The fists crossed, slithering and twisting like snakes crawling on a branch.</p>

<p>A dull clash echoes through the training ground. It was Walm's fist that caught him. This time, it was a familiar response. The fist that caught Deborah on the center line of her body, right in the face, was enough to break her nose. A spurt of fresh blood dripped onto the ground.</p>

<p>"Nice makeup. It suits you."</p>

<p>In response, the head instructor adjusted her crooked nose as she bit her nose and brushed the blood away into the void. He is neither frightened nor wavering. Then he began to reply to the seduction.</p>

<p>“You're asking me out in front of my husband!”</p>

<p>Deborah, her cheeks dyed vermilion, barks at him as if she were a maiden in love.</p>

<p>She was so in love that her cheeks flushed with vermilion.</p>

<p>Friug had been extremely busy since his arrival on the Celta Peninsula. In addition to the traditional duties of the company, he was also responsible for liaison and coordination with the Duchy of Myard's army. Most recently, they had just held a series of joint training exercises and discussions on deployment in the event of a contingency. In addition, as an ally, Celta must be taken into consideration in any way.</p>

<p>It is easy to say that we are equals, but in reality, prior communication and coordination are essential for anything we do. If the two countries had been cooperating for many years, there would be some know-how, but the two countries have only just begun to walk together. Tomorrow's schedule and soldier training swirled in my head. There was plenty to do. Friug was lost in thought as he walked, but he was interrupted by the sound of someone's voice.</p>

<p>"Is this Deborah's instructor training?　If that's the case."</p>

<p>To turn a frail citizen into a full-fledged soldier, it is necessary to take away his strength and energy and remake his thinking. The training of an instructor with a reputation for rough treatment is always accompanied by cursing, but this day was different. Rather than screams and yells, it was more like cheers.</p>

<p>What is the reference? Friug, intrigued, went to the training camp. The cheers grew louder and louder. A crowd had gathered in the center. It was not only the teaching corps. Infantrymen, sailors, cavalrymen, and others of all types and affiliations were all cheering and jubilating in unison.</p>

<p>“Chief Protector Walm!”</p>

<p>Friug peeked through the gap into the center and froze. There were imperial knights beating each other to a pulp, almost to the point of killing each other. His opponent was Deborah, the head instructor who had shown her prowess at Dandurg Castle. Friug spotted a familiar face among those leading the crowd and inquired.</p>

<p>“Hey, what's this all about?”</p>

<p>"Chuu, Lord Commander!　The Chief Protector Walm and the Chief Instructor Deborah are engaged in a hand-to-hand combat."</p>

<p>"I know it when I see it. I know it when I see it. That's what I'm asking.</p>

<p>At the feet of his men, alcohol and cigarettes are piled up in small piles. The soldiers, perhaps aware that they were guilty of something, replied in dismay.</p>

<p>“Well, well, at first we were betting on the evening meal, but then the liquor and other luxury items got together as well.”</p>

<p>The soldier's voice, which had been amused by the betting, became completely muffled. Moyes, the assistant to the head instructor, is busily receiving items and distributing pieces of wood in place of hangtags. Yogim is keeping a ledger of the participants. There was no doubt that father and son were in charge of the betting. This is why adventurers are so bad. They are doing what they have to do with a thin smile on their faces. Friug has a headache, but he alternates between the piles of delicacies and his subordinate, who is looking at his superior's face.</p>

<p>“So, how are the bets going?”</p>

<p>"Well, uh, four for the chief guardian and six for the chief instructor. The head instructor is the best fighter, so the Myard and Ferius teams are up for it."</p>

<p>Friug snickered at the report.</p>

<p>"Four chief guardians?　Is this a bunch of idiots? What did you see in Dundrug? What have you seen in Dandurg? Good, I'll bet you a barrel of wine that he's the chief of the guard."</p>

<p>The Highserk soldiers were amused by the daredevil company commander.</p>

<p>“Hey, the Highserk company commander bet the keg!”</p>

<p>“Bet on me too, don't lose!”</p>

<p>A fierce Celta sailor raises his voice. Myard's men, caught in the act, were more than happy to pile more goods on top of the barrels. The ones who benefited were probably Deborah and her family, who were in charge.</p>

<p>“Captain, may I ...... have a word?”</p>

<p>"I think we need to vent once in a while. It's a bit extreme, but it's good for socializing."</p>

<p>A betting match endorsed by the strictly disciplined company commander. The soldiers are immersed in the game as if they were fish out of water.</p>

<p>Friug did not express a single honest thought. Deborah is a woman who has transformed her bare hands into weapons. Friug also respects her abilities. On the other hand, Patroness Walm has no axe and spear, no magic, and cannot even use the “Hard Strike” or "Demon Fire. This must be a great disadvantage. But what does it matter that he is bare-handed? The chief protector remains the chief protector. That was enough.</p>

<p>As if to confirm Friug's monologue, a crash sounded that drowned out the cheers. The blood danced in the void. Their arms crossed over each other, and the guardian chief's fist punched him in the face. Deborah adjusts her own broken nose and holds back the dripping blood with a magical membrane to continue the battle.</p>

<p>Friug, who felt a shiver run down his spine, was mesmerized by the coming and going of the fists. He put aside his position as company commander for a moment and decided to enjoy the course of the hand-to-hand combat in front of him. It would be nice to have a day like this once in a while.</p>

<p>Episode 29</p>

<p>The night shadow, exposed by the pseudo-sun of the blue flame and having lost its place of destination, goes berserk.</p>

<p>“It's hot!”</p>

<p>If he were a common soldier, he would be drowned in the hot wind. Makoto simply declares, "It's hot. In addition to the jokey magic membrane, the sludge around him was reducing the “Demon Fire”. The location, which contains a large amount of water, is also unfavorable. In addition, the attack was designed to match Walm's strong fire resistance.</p>

<p>The eerie sludge, which contains a will, stalks Walm. The blue flames dance and run, easily blowing away the tracking mud. But this is not a drastic solution. Trouble was, the supply was inexhaustible. New tentacles slithered up from the ground, sucking up mud from the ground.</p>

<p>"Bad taste. Is that the seed of the mudslide?"</p>

<p>The magic was a combination of earth and water magic. The tentacles of mud moved as delicately as the arms they were born with. If it could move so freely, it would be easy to manipulate the ground loosened by heavy rains and the groundwater that had accumulated and cause a mudslide.</p>

<p>“Not as big as that one, though!”</p>

<p>The words exchanged like those of an old friend, but the magic is mixed in, trying to inflict a fatal blow on each other whenever the opportunity arises. Even the light-hearted conversation is a kind of deterrent and diversion. This highlights the combat experience and abnormality of both men. Pillars of fire scorch the canopy of the dark night, and raised mud stains the surroundings. Walm closed the distance through the gaps between such undulating tentacles of sludge. A fireball is projected from his slender arm as if to repel the imperial knight. Walm was about to close the distance when the surface of the mud appeared at the edge of his vision and he turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Immediately after, the burst sludge is scattered all around. It's not that he didn't like the persistent mud. The handcuffs and armor covering his neck make a high pitched clattering sound. The debris and nails were the remnants of houses. The worst recycling of ruins. Demon Masks covered with mud and debris trembled with rage. The target was subtle, either a lackey or a Walm who had failed to avoid it.</p>

<p>“I'm glad you like it!”</p>

<p>“You little shit!”</p>

<p>Mako, her voice bouncing with age, dared to attack again. The tentacles of sludge containing a large amount of debris turned into improvised shrapnel bombs. But Walm is not so patient as to sit back and watch as the fuse ignites. Before the fireball is shot, he blows away the sludge thorns with blue flames and hot air.</p>

<p>The positions of the two were switched, and it was MAKOTO who was forced to take evasive action. The wall of sludge caught a large amount of debris. The defense against explosives, including shrapnel, is beyond reproach. It could even be said to be superior. However, for Walm, who was trying to get close to it, it was an easy-to-use shield.</p>

<p>"You!</p>

<p>Makoto pushes off his arm. A line of shadows ran across his vision. Walm's eyes narrowed and he sank into a prone position, using the hot air as propulsion to ignore the structure of the human body. Two shells pierced through the place where the chest and lower abdomen used to be. The true nature of these shells are earth bullets, which are most frequently used in earth attribute magic.</p>

<p>“Oh no, movement.”</p>

<p>For the first time, Makoto was shaken. He relied on the earth bullets, which were quick to fire. He could not avoid a cut. Abandoning the maneuver battle using his legs, Makoto drew his shortsword.</p>

<p>The blade of wind was released as he drew his sword, and Walm had no intention of giving him time to gain distance. The axe-spear, which was swung down from the uppermost position, was charged with magic power and fought head-on against the magic that twists reason. The rivalry is momentary, and even the remnants of the wind that cut through the spear are drowned out by the hot wind.</p>

<p>"Ha--aah!</p>

<p>It was MAKOTO who made the first move. Using his unique gait technique, he shrank back and slid in. He knew how to fight in the opposite direction of Walm's dominant hand, which spearmen hate. In addition, he had the timing to compensate for the shortness of his blade. The blunt axe-head was not drawn back in time.</p>

<p>Walm blocked a thrust aimed at his throat with the hilt. A screeching cutting sound echoed as the metal scraped. The blade of the short sword tracing the hilt aims for his finger. He stretches out his elbow and pushes the blade away from his close contact with the sword. The danger is not over yet. The tip of the sword wavers, and a second thrust comes without a pause. Walm turns his wrist, turns his axe spear, and hits the blade hard with a stone thrust. The shortsword rises slightly, but the difference in the characteristics of the weapons again puts him ahead.</p>

<p>The correction of muscle power by the magical membrane turns the small soldier into a monstrous force, but there is still a limit. Walm took advantage of the difference in size to put his physical language to use. While deflecting the axe spear aside, he pulled up the knee of the side he was stepping on to his chest and kicked down in one swift motion.</p>

<p>“Nah--ggh, ugh!”</p>

<p>The sole that extended in a straight line pierced his lower abdomen at the shortest distance. Quickly, Makoto deflects his upper body and deflects the impact backward, but he cannot escape until the impact. Walm, having secured a suitable spacing for the axe spear, swings. Makoto, on the other hand, prioritizes area and impact. He shoots out a water bullet.</p>

<p>Walm did not take any evasive action, nor did he cut off both sides of the magic with 《Hard Strike》. Since their encounter at Sarajevo Fortress, Makoto had grown up. The amount of magic power he was blessed with, the skill he showed in not being swayed by attribute magic, the swordsmanship he showed when he was caught in the middle, and the training he had put in were all impressive. But even Walm did not just spend his days in stagnation. He asks with his eyes. You've never seen my maximum firepower.</p>

<p>“Justan, brace yourself!”</p>

<p>“Arghh!”</p>

<p>The shot was a warning to my allies. Walm unleashed the biggest blue flame since the Undead Dragon. The water projectile dissolved into the atmosphere after a slight resistance. Makoto bites his canine teeth in pain. The flames that burned even the dragon were so fierce that even the user could turn on them. The damage is so great that it even reaches the enemy soldiers attacking the church building.</p>

<p>Demon Mask, in a good mood, urges the rest of the story as if he were talking about something else. Walm, on the other hand, cleaves his axe spear to the side without saying a word. Mako, temporarily stripped of most of the magical membrane she had deployed, is not yet dead in the eye. He readies his shortsword and attempts to retreat.</p>

<p>“Ha, ah!”</p>

<p>The “hard blow” strikes the shortsword and eats through the defenses. The axe head, which does not know how to retreat, is coming for the thin throat." Walm is convinced that he has it, but the arm that is thrust out overturns his imagination. The cuirass is shattered, and the blade stops when the bone is severed. The arm shakes with a little flesh and skin.</p>

<p>“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.”</p>

<p>The magical membrane deploys again, but it shakes awkwardly due to the intense pain. It barely prevented major bleeding, but only postponed the impending collapse.</p>

<p>“It's a dead end.”</p>

<p>The axe spear held straight up was a warning of sorts.</p>

<p>“Don't look at me with those pathetic eyes!”</p>

<p>The loss of the function of his left arm did not dampen Mako's will to fight. Walm does not hesitate to try to stop him.</p>

<p>“Don't you dare!”</p>

<p>The arm, bare from the elbow up, is thrust out. Unlike the neat flow of magic power that used to use various kinds of magic, the disordered consciousness and exposed nerves disturbed the magic power. It is as if the four attributes are mixed together. A projection of agonizing magic from a shredded arm. It was supposed to be a bad attempt.</p>

<p>"Three magic attacks!　No, no."</p>

<p>The chaos was like a mess of paints on a palette. However, the “three magic blows” passed over the similarity of the two. As Walm once said, it is only in times of distress that a person's true strength comes out. A blow similar to the "Three Magic Blows. It was a “heavy bomb” with four attributes. A torrent of magical power shot into the ground, causing the mud to rise up, tinged with light. A girl from my hometown was laughing at the center of it. Walm, manipulating the hot air and falling backward, inflated his Demon Fire with the remaining magical power.</p>

<p>“Ah--?”</p>

<p>Makoto's voice was a pause. Immediately after, there was a flash of light. It was as if my retinas were being burned by the light. A pillar of chaotic magical power stands up. Walm was slammed into the mud and sunk halfway down, but ironically, his body was protected from the torrent of magical power.</p>

<p>“Damn, my eyes are distorted.”</p>

<p>Walm's retinas flicker and burn in the murky flash. It was only a passing thing, but having too good an eye is also a problem. In addition, the leg that unleashed the front kick sizzled and ached.</p>

<p>“You were stroked and slashed when you crossed ...... Mako.”</p>

<p>If you bounce off the heavy mud and search your surroundings, you will find that the remaining fire from 《Demon Fire》 and 《Heavy Bomb》 is smoldering all around you. The battle had also concluded in the church hall in the aftermath. Wollum stood up with his axe and spear as a staff. Walm began to walk with heavy steps.</p>

<p>Pieces of flesh splattered on the burning, dried-up blast site. Beside the broken sword, the left arm, which had been a man's, was lying as if grasping something. The burnt fingers were like twigs that had been burned off.</p>

<p>"...... outburst?　That guy blew himself up."</p>

<p>There was no way to eliminate the threat, to send a message to the squad, or to kill a fellow countryman whose humanity had degenerated. Walm was prepared for this. But this is the state of affairs - not even a corpse remains.</p>

<p>How will you explain this to Ayane? The most important thing to remember is that the best way to get the most out of your money is to make sure you have the best possible use of your money.</p>

<p>Dry laughter. Walm, unable to think straight, puts away his Demon Mask and scratches his bangs. He just stares at the remains of the girl. Her charred ring finger crumbles in the wind.</p>

        <p>Episode 5</p>

        <p>Friug was busy conferring with the executive committee on the occasion of transporting supplies and personnel
            to Celta, the Duchy of Myard. After all, the amount to be transported was enormous. If the Transportation
            Corps, light infantry platoon, and non-combatants were included, four hundred people would be moving at
            once. The complexity of confirming names, procuring provisions and fodder, and the various procedures and
            coordination was mind-boggling. A decade ago, these difficult tasks and preparations would have been handled
            by civilian officials, but it has been a long time since anyone who could use them was told to use the dead
            or demons.</p>

        <p>I always thought the empire couldn't afford it, but I envy those days, even though I miss them."</p>

        <p>Friug uttered an unproductive blur. In the first place, large scale trading is inefficient. It would be more
            efficient to have a small number of people constantly coming and going, with less burden on each location
            and better efficiency in transportation. The reason for the time-consuming formation is that the control of
            the transportation route known as the Flame Emperor Dragon Corridor is incomplete. The corridor is flanked
            on both sides by a wide expanse of demon territory, and Myard and Highserk are only connected by a thin
            line. A single cutoff is all it takes to sever the connection between the two countries.</p>

        <p>Fortunately, the platoon commander of the Transportation Corps, who is on joint duty, is an experienced
            veteran of the field. Friug has heard that he has survived multiple attacks during transportation, and that
            during the Great Outbreak, he did not abandon his cargo and carried it through. Friug, who was unfamiliar
            with the internal affairs of the company, was assisted at the meeting by his accumulated expertise and
            skills.</p>

        <p>The platoon leader's name was Hodie, right? He must have come from the former Western Army, which has a lot
            of experience in actual combat.</p>

        <p>He must have been given preferential treatment, considering the serious shortage of human resources. The
            military leadership is also looking forward to the return of a soldier. There was even an uproar among the
            commanders of Hadro's regiment in the Southern Area Army, Zeref's brigade in the East, and Justus's brigade
            in Myard over the assignment of Walm's guardianship. Furthermore, even Viscount Edgar and the Marquis of
            Torrio, lords of the archipelago countries, attempted to contact him in order to bring him under their
            control. It was fortuitous that they did not snatch him away and that he returned to the capital.</p>

        <p>Friug returned his attention to the cargo on his way home. The Duchy of Myard has taken control of the Lehun
            mines of the defunct Kingdom of Felius, and has begun to employ and operate those who have drifted in as
            refugees. Payment for the materials and food that flowed in from Highserk was made with refined iron and
            marine products. Myard, too, had lost much, but it was vigorous in its efforts to regain power. The grand
            duchess of Myard, though misguided for a time, now ruled Celta as a monarch. Friug was impressed.</p>

        <p>Friug, who was busy checking the information on the sign, raised his eyes at the sound of approaching
            footsteps. The footsteps were probably a clear indication that he was about to visit the room. He was ready
            for a response before long.</p>

        <p>Captain, you have a visitor. The Chief Protector of Walm is here to see you.</p>

        <p>Please come in at once.</p>

        <p>Friug did not wait for Walm to enter, but rose from his chair to greet him. He was a knight, an honorary rank
            in the old military organization, but one of the few still alive in the Empire today. In Dundurg, although
            he was a temporary wartime rank of battalion commander, he led a mixed battalion and performed
            lion-heartedly in the war. Without the guardian general, Dundueg Castle would have fallen without a moment's
            thought. Friug would never have been allowed to greet such a man sitting in his chair.</p>

        <p>I'm sorry to bother you.</p>

        <p>No, I was just stuck and thought I'd take a break--is something wrong?"</p>

        <p>As they exchanged words, Friug could sense the frustration in their body language and facial expressions. The
            chief guard rarely reveals his emotions outwardly. Prompted, Walm began to explain the situation.</p>

        <p>I had no idea that your brother was still alive."</p>

        <p>Friug's voice trailed off in annoyance as he grasped the situation. Relatives, friends, acquaintances,
            Highserk people have lost their neighbors in one way or another. It is not uncommon to find that some people
            have lost their entire families. Friug, too, has lost many connections. In such a situation, a blood brother
            is a precious thing. The rest of the chief guardian's family and villagers, without exception, have gone to
            the underworld.</p>

        <p>Friug was quick to act in response to the gravity of the situation. He puts away the tools of his trade
            spread out on his desk and pulls out a military map from a locked drawer. Although less accurate and precise
            than the maps distributed to battalion and regimental commanders, they contain far more information than the
            crude maps on the market. After all, the maps are constantly being updated and have just been modified
            today.</p>

        <p>“Where is the village?”</p>

        <p>“Here.”</p>

        <p>Friug looks at the spot indicated by Walm and asks himself, "Where is it?</p>

        <p>It is inside our effective territory, but close to our provisional boundary.</p>

        <p>The location of the village is not favorable. It was located along the demon territory and Liberitoa
            territory, even though it was within our sphere of control.</p>

        <p>A reasonable force has been deployed to recapture the old territory and to monitor the border. Accidental
            fighting is unlikely.</p>

        <p>The Liberitoa Trade Federation is prioritizing the seizure of the Celta lakeshore and rivers in the former
            Highserk territory, which has been swallowed up by the demon territory. An immediate full-scale offensive is
            not expected. Although the military foresees a major military intervention within the next few years, there
            has been no cross-border action so far, and the two countries remain outwardly quiet. Still, there is the
            danger of underestimated demons.</p>

        <p>Friug looks up and sees Walm staring at the map with a hole in his eye. If he misses his chance and his
            family leaves for another country, the search will be extremely difficult. They may not be reunited in this
            life. The chief guardian, Walm, played a major role in the existence of the empire. He should at least be
            able to fulfill the smallest of wishes to be reunited with his family.</p>

        <p>"Chief Protector Walm, if you can make it back in four days, you can go home.</p>

        <p>I am sorry to trouble you, but please let me go.</p>

        <p>Of course. I would have accompanied you, but...</p>

        <p>But it's a busy time. You must give priority to your military duties. Besides. If I took a soldier with me on
            a simple homecoming trip, my brother would laugh at me for being overprotective.</p>

        <p>This was a reasonable argument. In fact, there are only a few soldiers under his command who are free. Should
            he forcefully extract an escort? Friug was conflicted, but the image of Walm striking back at the demons
            while commanding the front line came to mind. It may be a futile consideration. In Dandeweg, he had taken on
            the Great Outbreak, and in the Labyrinth City, he had survived in all five in the face of the Undead Dragon.
            I can't imagine him dying in battle.</p>

        <p>“Escorting is a wild thing, isn't it? ...... Take care on your way.”</p>

        <p>Friug tried to maintain an objective viewpoint as a soldier, but for the soldiers who had fought through
            Dundurg under Walm's command, Walm was their absolute leader. It could be said that their belief in him led
            to blindness. No matter how much power he possessed, he was only a man. The bloodstained history of the
            northern countries is that even numerous heroes, heroic heroes, and military gods were exposed to the wounds
            of the enemy regardless of the battlefield.</p>

        <p>The Wolm had been alone for so long.</p>

        <p>Walm had been on the frontlines of many battles on his own, and after his country collapsed, he wandered the
            archipelago. After the collapse of his country, he wandered around the archipelago. He did not need to make
            extensive preparations to leave the country, and he ran straight to his destination after receiving
            permission from Friug, the head of the trading company.</p>

        <p>On his way back home, he did not fail to think about returning to his hometown. Thoughts of longing for home
            swirled in his mind and came to mind again and again. What inhibited them was a kind of fear. If I visited
            the village I had burned with my own hands, I would have to accept the fact, even if I didn't want to. The
            events of the past were a bad daydream, and he would be glad to know that people were still living and that
            his relatives were still there to greet him.</p>

        <p>I have to accept the fact that I will never go back to ....... The hands of the clock never turn back."</p>

        <p>After a year and a half, his experiences in the archipelago countries, and the survival of his siblings, Walm
            has come to terms with the fact that he is right. Considering the progress he had made so far, the journey
            home was a short one. Walm breathlessly continues down a road that is still vivid in his memory. It was a
            path he had once taken, but now that it had left the hands of man, the forest was encroaching on it,
            blocking it.</p>

        <p>The more he searches through his memories, the more he remembers his childhood, which he once put a lid on.
            The forest where I played around with the neighborhood kids and my older brother until the sun went down,
            the well-trodden country roads, the rocks and trees we used as landmarks. The sour taste of the sweet and
            sour raspberries he ate with his brother comes to mind.</p>

        <p>When I swing my axe and spear instead of a machete, the perennial grasses that block my path fall to the
            ground in a wild spin. The juices sticking to the edge of the blade irritated my nostrils, but the pungent
            smell was less irritating than that of humans or demons, so I felt at ease.</p>

        <p>Walm had feared that demons might attack, but he has yet to encounter any. The troops stationed at the
            boundary were probably very diligent in their work and excellent. In the meantime, a fence with intricately
            entangled vines appeared in his field of vision. The fence had not been repaired since I left the village
            for military service, but now it only vaguely retains its original shape. My heart beats with regret. The
            owner of the fence was frozen like a statue, and the demon's mask trembled as if urging him on.</p>

        <p>I know. Don't rush me.</p>

        <p>Walm let out a breath, calmed his mind, and took a step forward. The village, which had been reduced to ashes
            by the blue flames, was now surrounded by greenery. Compared to the dirt road so far, the erosion of the
            forest is slower. As far as he could remember, he searched for the bodies of the villagers who had crossed
            over into the underworld, but there were none left. Walm bends down to stick to his feet and stares at the
            ground. There were lines and footprints all over the place where something had been dragged.</p>

        <p>He followed them as if he were being led. The multiple traces all extended into the village square. Unlike
            the outer edge of the village, it had been artificially cleared of vegetation and debris. A grave marker
            made from the foundation material of a house sat in the center. Probably, all the remains were placed under
            it. There were even offerings of flowers and sake.</p>

        <p>As if buoyed by the heat of the moment, I walked onward. A man was standing in front of the gravestone. Walm
            was speechless as if mud were stuck in his throat, but his half boot, on which he had stepped on a pebble
            due to lack of attention, took the place of its owner and asserted his presence. The man who turned around
            also opened his eyes in surprise.</p>

        <p>Walm ......? Long time no see."</p>

        <p>The elder brother spoke his brother's name. Yes, he called his name. Walm was worried. The more he kills to
            survive on the battlefield, the more his nature as a human being changes. Whether it is morality,
            conscience, or something else is not certain. What is certain, nevertheless, is that his appearance and his
            eyes change, as if pulled by his spirit and inner life. I wondered if his family would recognize him as the
            brother he really is when they saw his face. These fears were unfounded.</p>

        <p>“Ahhhh!”</p>

        <p>It was an unattractive response. It was a poor response. Still, the older brother greeted Walm without making
            fun of him.</p>

        <p>Welcome home. Welcome home.</p>

        <p>“I'm back.” ".......</p>

        <p>Walm shuddered at the reply, which he had never received on his previous trips home, even though he was the
            only one.</p>

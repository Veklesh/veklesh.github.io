<p>Episode 59</p>

<p>A bell, a terribly grating bell, rings erratically. The eye lids are tightly closed, but the pure white flashes are still burned into my retinas. My whole body floated, as if I had sunk to the bottom of the water, unable to move. Friug, who was struggling for breath and feeling oppressed, pushed away something that was weighing him down.</p>

<p>“Huh, hah...... duh!”</p>

<p>An avalanche of dust falls from his raised upper body. He spits out the gravel stuck in his mouth with saliva. Eyes adapting to the light belatedly, they slowly reflect the surroundings. Grayish dust drifts in a thick cloud, more than the height of a man. Unidentifiable fragments litter the surroundings, and holes are drilled in the earth as if picked up by giants. Someone was shouting in Friug's ear as he sat up in a daze.</p>

<p>"--yo!　Choo, ugh."</p>

<p>A man stained with sweat and blood repeatedly shakes his shoulder. What in the world is going on? Friug frowned at the clamor. His vision was not quite steady, but it gradually came into focus. The man's face was smudged, as if he had gone down a fireplace chimney, but he looked familiar. A few breaths later, oxygen finally circulated to his acid-deprived brain.</p>

<p>"Commander!　Captain Friug, Captain of the company!　Give me an order, give me an order!"</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.” "Quickly!　They're going to dig up the whole town of Shukuba.</p>

<p>It was Saura, the most senior non-commissioned officer in the company, who begged for orders. Friug, who had regained his senses, stayed down and surveyed the situation. The line of defense had been made of debris, and the line had been cut to shreds. A flash of lightning had struck the inn town. The destruction, which was not the result of the concentrated operation of mage soldiers, but of a single mage soldier, was probably the “holy strike” that had been reported.</p>

<p>The attack magic, which was originally supposed to be wielded in the rearguard action and the attack on the city, struck the company. The troops, which had been reinforced by taking in the remnants of the defeated soldiers, lost the majority of their fighting ability. The head held by firepower, a breakthrough is about to be made into the interior of the peninsula. As a front-line commander, the experience he had cultivated warned him that he should pull back immediately. But now that he was mercilessly aware of the entire board - now that he knew, he could not just give Friug that order.</p>

<p>"The dust obstructed my vision, and I had to regroup my flanks in a haphazard or ...... dust of enemy attacks. It could be thin or distorted. Keep your men on the ground until the enemy enters."</p>

<p>The 《Holy Strike》, which has better penetration than attack range, is smashing through the rubble and digging up the earth. It was a great 《Skill》, but it was overkill against a company of lightly armed infantry. Therefore, Friug had an opening to take advantage of. Apart from the first few shots, the dust creates a smokescreen that makes his aim inconsistent. This is a byproduct of randomly targeting houses and rubble in front of and behind which soldiers might be hiding. The dust that has accumulated over the long history of the inn town erupts at the end of each step.</p>

<p>“Like this, inside?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Ahead of Saura's bewildered gaze, the soldiers who received a direct hit from the “Holy Strike” are obliterated and turned into a mist of blood. The tragedy in front of him was condemning, but Friug did not change his opinion.</p>

<p>“If you run, you will only be struck in the back.”</p>

<p>Saura looked up to the heavens, but the blue sky was blocked by drifting dust. All that was there was a cloud pattern covered in ash. The old man, his resolve tinged with resignation, replied ostentatiously to Friug.</p>

<p>“Ha, as you wish.”</p>

<p>The courteous underling crawled on the ground like a lizard and disappeared into the rubble. Soon after, the scattered soldiers alternately cursed and screamed. A flash of light and a blast of flame passes over the heads of the company members as they roll and slide and gather, and the slight bumps and debris hold the soldiers' lives together.</p>

<p>“I can't do it, I can't do it.”</p>

<p>“You idiot - don't get up!”</p>

<p>The roar and impact cause delirium, and the soldier, ignoring his comrades' attempts to restrain him, gets up, but the upper half of his body is obliterated when he is kidnapped by the explosion flame that lands on him. Friug and the other generals gritted their teeth and held on, even though their skin was burned by the sparks of fire and the debris hit their protective gear. As if a storm was about to pass, a sudden silence fell over the battlefield.</p>

<p>"Hold your positions until my signal.</p>

<p>Friug's words, a small command, were transmitted by junior officers and veterans. It was the end of the fire suppression, but it was also the beginning of the general attack. With a booming shout, the soles of countless shoes hit the ground. Their movements were filled with confusion.</p>

<p>“I can't see anything!”</p>

<p>"Keep in step!</p>

<p>“What do you mean, ‘assault’ ......?”</p>

<p>That's the attack, they're all gone.</p>

<p>Ears on the ground pick up the sound of footsteps and the murmurs of soldiers. Through the dust, I caught a glimpse of Craist's soldiers, bewildered, having lost sight of the enemy they were supposed to be fighting. The soldiers under his command, half buried in the dirt and rubble, turn their glazed eyes toward them. Far away, still far away. Friug pulls back to the limit. Endurance was something he was used to.</p>

<p>“All hands, meet and strike!”</p>

<p>“Giiiyaa!!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>The company, which had been heaving on the ground, rose all at once to greet the Craist soldiers. There was no need for brilliant technique or mastery. They just went after anyone who caught their eye. Friug slashed at the necks of those who were engaged in conversation, and slammed his sword into their helmets. Craist's soldiers, who had been out of their minds, were unable to put up any kind of resistance, and fell to the ground in the form of being replaced by Highserk's soldiers. The men simply followed their superiors.</p>

<p>“It's an ambush!”</p>

<p>“They endured it in there!”</p>

<p>Covered in dust and with their skin worn off from their clothes, the soldiers looked like the dead. Regardless of their appearance, the company, led by the generals who had survived Dandurg Castle, functioned to the fullest as a violent machine. Stabbed to death, bludgeoned to death, or shot to death, the front ranks of Craist's soldiers were subjected to the imperial welcome of massacre. Taking advantage of the situation, the Highserk soldiers even turned the tables on them. But only for a time. It was the last spark before the fire was extinguished. It could not last for long.</p>

<p>“Giiiiiyaa--!”</p>

<p>"Don't leave a gap!</p>

<p>When one line of the continuous formation was broken, the Royal Army of Craist solemnly advanced the next line. Friug's company, which had been exhausted and worn out, had no power left to bounce back.</p>

<p>"We are only a small force after all, kill them one by one without fail!</p>

<p>The squadron was originally a single line that was on the verge of loosening and unraveling. Once they got together properly, they could easily be eaten through. The shredded lines became dots at various points, and in the face of their efforts, they were surrounded and taken out.</p>

<p>“No, no, they'll break through!”</p>

<p>"Captain, join up!　We are surrounded!"</p>

<p>This was especially true in the center. The left wing, which was led by Saura, was on the verge of collapse, but the right wing had been destroyed, and the center, which was led by Friug himself, was about to be destroyed. The oldest junior officer advised him to join up, but he was already unwilling to do so. First of all, Friug had sent his enemies and friends to their deaths. There was no way he could be overlooked.</p>

<p>“Saura, gather your forces, you're in command now.”</p>

<p>"I'm not joking. What nonsense!</p>

<p>"I'll buy you time. I'll buy you some time.</p>

<p>No matter how much they wanted to, organized resistance was not going to happen. He was already too weak to be called a commander. There is only the roar of an animal and the scrambling of each individual.</p>

<p>"Some of them are going down. Let's pursue ......!</p>

<p>Friug cuts down the knight's squire who ordered him to avenge the backs of the soldiers who are deserting the battlefield, and he breaks into view. I do not remember that I am so weak that I can be killed at a moment's notice, even if I have wounds all over my body. I will be here, I will proclaim with my sword.</p>

<p>“Damn, they're in my way, they're dead and they think they're my lord!”</p>

<p>"Take out the commander!　Then this ridiculous resistance will be over."</p>

<p>Now, strike!</p>

<p>The knight blasted the group of spearmen, who raised their spears and approached Friug. The knights blasted the spears, and a group of spearmen approached Friug with spears in the air. There was no time to avoid them, and they simply braced themselves for the impact by supporting their swords with their handholds. The blows from the downward blows were powerful. The tips of the spears, which could not be cut, creaked the collarbone and spine through the armor and bounced off the helmets.</p>

<p>"Next!</p>

<p>Friug, who had bitten his teeth and endured the pain, called out and reaped the spear that was about to be pulled back with his longsword. The tip of one spear was severed, and another was bent halfway through the mouthpiece. If the earlier strike had been with a long spear, even one of his arms would have been broken. If the strike had been poorly placed, he would have ended up with his head crushed.</p>

<p>“Here it comes!”</p>

<p>The Craist soldiers, who had lost their function as spears, responded in different ways. After a moment of hesitation, some threw down what had been a spear, while others tried to poke it as a stick. Friug closed the gap without avoiding it. The hilt pierced his breastplate, but after a moment of antagonism, it slid across the surface and drifted to the side. Before the soldier could finish drawing his shortsword, Friug, who had thrown away the damaged spear, flashed his longsword. The tip of the sword bit through the helmet and the side of the head, sending the soldier's eyeballs spinning in the wrong direction. After swinging the tip of the sword seven times, the spearmen died.</p>

<p>“Huh--hah, hah, hah.”</p>

<p>Surrounded by the corpses, he regulates his breathing and looks for the next enemy. His gaze is glued to a gap in the slightly opened ranks. Far off in the distance, at the back of the line, he could see it.</p>

<p>“Asa, Makka!”</p>

<p>Yuto Asama, one of the three heroes of the Craist Royal Army. He was within arm's reach. Who could pretend not to notice?</p>

<p>“Go on, I'll get the heads of the three heroes!”</p>

<p>Not more than five fingers responded to the call. Even so, it was enough for Friug.</p>

<p>"Are you still going to fight?</p>

<p>“Are you still going to fight?”</p>

<p>Yuto had thought he had carefully destroyed all the inn towns and people. But even with all that destruction, they had survived. Some lay in the shadows of ruins, others in hollows. Even the demons of the demon territory would abandon their territory and flee if they were hit by a “holy blow” at close range. But humans, who are more vulnerable than demons, have not lost their will to fight, and have stayed on by sheer force of will.</p>

<p>“Surrender and you'll be saved, but why go that far ......?”</p>

<p>Desperation, or impatience to fight, you say? The world is too different. The enemy group, which at one point had begun to counterattack, was being reduced in numbers, piling up wreckage and disintegrating as fast as it could. I understood the meaning and significance of this battle. Still, it was not something I could accept from the bottom of my heart. The enemy left wing had lost every single soldier, and the center was about to follow suit. The right wing, which was still holding its shape, would be engulfed in a chain of disintegration and would run out of strength.</p>

<p>The two sides were engaged in a hand-to-hand combat. If they fire a “holy strike,” they will engulf their friends. There was nothing more he could do as a magician. Yuto, at the very least, burned in his eyes the sight of their last moments. One soldier, who had lost one hand but still wielded a sword, led several others to their deaths.</p>

<p>But their individual struggles do nothing to reverse the tide of the battle. Yuto frowns bitterly, but his gaze is caught by a gap that suddenly opens up unnaturally.</p>

<p>“What--?”</p>

<p>There was the dead commander of the Highserk army. Instantly, our gazes meet. The eyes speak eloquently. On the battlefield, which could be called madness, the powerful twin eyes of the Highserk still held intelligence. So, Yuto got an answer. Whatever it is, they are also fighting for something they cannot give up. They will not give up. This battle will continue until one of them collapses.</p>

<p>“Go on, I'm going to capture the heads of the three heroes.”</p>

<p>Yuto was called by the two names he had accumulated by killing people. He faced him coming toward him with the four remaining soldiers in the center. It was clear that they had no strength left to overcome a wall of soldiers four or five rows deep. Swords cut through them, spears chipped away at their armor. Soon they would be swamped by the waves of people and run out of strength.</p>

<p>“Aim at their limbs, make sure they stop moving.”</p>

<p>“It's only a few of them, don't let them escape!”</p>

<p>The soldiers in pursuit had all run out of strength after crossing the third line. The lone commander continued to cut his way through. He did not stop. He crossed the fourth line. The escorting knights interrupted forward in alarm. The Highserk commander is no longer avoiding a mortal wound. He holds fast only to the parts necessary to reach Yout and slays the Craist soldiers who prevent his path. The way he does not even raise his voice, wasting even the breath he takes in screams and shouts, is one word for abnormal.</p>

<p>“You'll get away with it, Highserk!”</p>

<p>“Youto-sama, take this.”</p>

<p>He must have been conceited somewhere. Not everything in the world can be measured by your own scale. The Highserkers had made a breakthrough that they had deemed reckless and impossible, and they had succeeded in doing so. But at the same time, they exhausted everything in the fifth column. A spear pierced through the Highserk's back and torso. In the instant that they stopped moving with bloodshot breath, the tips of their swords, the tips of their spears, rushed in.</p>

<p>“You ...... stopped.”</p>

<p>The legs tried to move forward, but the crucified body did not move a step from its spot. His movements became slower and slower, and he sagged like a puppet with broken strings. There was no one who did not feel relief at the sight. The soldier's breakthrough was that divine. Yuto was no exception. The tension that had been building up in him was released with an exhale. It was such a moment. The arms of the Highserk man who had been drooping were shaken. A chill crawled up my spine. The sword thrown from the palm of his hand came straight at him. Youto quickly braced himself, but there was no need. He was struck down by the sword held by the knight escorting him. A blow that did not reach him. A high-pitched metallic sound lingered in his ears like a scream.</p>

<p>“What a guy!”</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>"No, I'm fine. I'm fine."</p>

<p>Yuto answered without taking his eyes off the sword that was thrust at his feet. Even though it was a bad move, the commander of Highserk, who had been pierced by several swords and spears in such a large number of people, was trying to fulfill his role. Yout could not help but feel awe. Still, this would be the end of the battle in the inn town. Despite Yout's thoughts, the clamor returned to the battlefield, which should have calmed down once before.</p>

<p>“Foolish, the remaining enemies are turning back!”</p>

<p>"It's a bluff. What are you afraid of in death? Push off quickly!"</p>

<p>Yuto couldn't believe his eyes. The Highserk soldiers, who should have retreated, had once again turned on their heels toward the inn town. Are you saying that they are martyrs to their commanders?</p>

<p>“Huh, heh, you're the ones exposing the wreckage!”</p>

<p>“Dedicate their deaths to their company commanders!”</p>

<p>“Glory to Highserk, glory to Myard!”</p>

<p>This is reckless. Inspired by their commander, they are all going to die. Yout shouted.</p>

<p>"Your commander is down, and you still want to die for nothing!　Damn it."</p>

<p>The enemy's words did not reach them. Spitting out, Youto crowded toward the commander of the fallen Highserk forces.</p>

<p>“Yout-sama, please move away.”</p>

<p>“The enemy may slip through again.”</p>

<p>Yout picked up a faint voice, mingled with the calls of the escorting knights.</p>

<p>“Wait, something is talking.”</p>

<p>Yout, kneeling with his sword in his hand as a precaution, listened to the dying soldier.</p>

<p>"Ha, ah, kii, it's ....... I'm here."</p>

<p>Meaningless words leaked from his bloodless lips. Yuto called out again, hoping that he still had some sanity left in him.</p>

<p>“Call the remaining soldiers to surrender, are you going to kill them for nothing, hey?”</p>

<p>What came back from the dying Highserk was a spine-chilling smile. Yuto jumped back at the fearless spirit.</p>

<p>"This time, it's here. Our fire, ha-ha-ha, burn and go away. Craist."</p>

<p>“Oooh, what--!”</p>

<p>Before I can even comprehend the meaning, the air heats up and the wind blows. There is no way to forget the magic that scorches its skin. Just like the battlefield of the past, or even more so than before, a hot wind with the stench of death and misery drifts over the battlefield.</p>

<p>"You've been waiting for him!</p>

<p>Yuto's question ended in a soliloquy. There was already no one in the world to answer, and he crossed into the underworld with a satisfied look on his face, as if he had fulfilled a promise.</p>

<p>"Impossible, why him!　Deputy Commander Cylance and Ratu must have stopped him."</p>

<p>“You monster, you have defeated him in such a short period of time!”</p>

<p>Contrary to the dismay of the knights, the imperial knight calmly ordered his company as he had done in the past.</p>

<p>“All hands, retreat!”</p>

<p>Those under his command at the ancient castle of Dandurg correctly understood his intention. As they rolled back, Craist's soldiers rushed in.</p>

<p>“Don't let them use it, kill them!”</p>

<p>In addition to the dense formation, the ruined town was turned into fuel, firewood. With the hot wind, blue flames swirl high into the sky, and the entire inn town is burned to the ground by Craist's soldiers. The hot winds transformed the screams into a horrifying tone, like a distorted mourning song.</p>

<p>“What a bastard!”</p>

<p>Blue flames spread across the field of vision. Those without magical membranes were helplessly turned into bonfires. Even the dependable dense formation became a cage that did not allow any evacuation action in the face of Demon Fire. In such a purgatory, the imperial knight walked with ease. Behind the Demon Mask, a golden eye emerges from the sea of blue flames. The shining and cloudy eyes speak eloquently to Yuto. Then, he is convinced of one thing. There is no other way but to kill him before he kills you. Yuto, shot through with the will to kill, clenched his sword tightly.</p>

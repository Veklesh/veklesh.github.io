<p>What Do You Wish for with Cloudy Eyes II: The Battle of Highserk" is now on sale!</p>

<p>Please read it over the holidays, as we have added some behind-the-scenes details of the story that were not fully told in the main Web version!</p>

<p>At the base of a dimly lit grove, Walm was crawling on his belly among the piles of fallen leaves. He continued to observe the shrubs and weeds growing modestly through the trees, trying not to deviate from their height.</p>

<p>“Do you see the four sentinels at the gate and the single-tiered watchtower?”</p>

<p>I am not talking to myself. It was a multi-person reconnaissance to increase the accuracy of the information. The heat was so intense that the strong soldiers were crowded so closely together that their breath seemed to be in contact with each other. Justan, who was down like a skulk, squinted his eyes and nodded after a good and present recognition.</p>

<p>"Yeah, there are two archers up there. There must be six more in the walled corridor."</p>

<p>"I'm sure there are soldiers of the same size on the opposite ramparts. As per prior information, there must be 40 to 50 men including those inside the castle."</p>

<p>The distance was about 200 meters. The fortress, built on the side of a small mountain, serves as a barrier. The walls, a mixture of wood and stone, extended up to the gentle slope of the valley and blocked the mountain path to screen visitors. The supply of stone was in short supply in Yalıkıkı due to the large amount of stone brought to the mountain fortress in Lehun, but the local lords and engineers compensated for this with their ingenuity and ingenuity. Walm did not like the industrious enemy.</p>

<p>"It has a vertical moat, albeit a gentle slope. I don't want to get shot in the back by an archer and roll off."</p>

<p>An unfamiliar warhorse procured in the mountain castle attached to the Lehun mine. If they were forced to cross the slope, Walm would be the first casualty due to his poor horsemanship. After finishing their scouting, the men cautiously select a foothold and head for the shadow of the mountain where Ayane and the others, their escort, are waiting.</p>

<p>“We have no choice but to force our way through the fortress.”</p>

<p>The result was based on the results of the enemy reconnaissance, but the reaction was slow.</p>

<p>"It's that defense. It's better to go around ......."</p>

<p>One of the few cavalry survivors who accompanied him throws an alternative suggestion to Justan. Walm, too, wanted to play it safe if possible.</p>

<p>"Impossible. Everywhere is stretched. If we abandon the horses, we will not make it back to the Celta peninsula in time. As a result, this ancient road is the thinnest and fastest."</p>

<p>Iasanto, the enemy's ten-man commander, who had succeeded in capturing the men alive, brought us useful information such as the number of men at the fort that also served as a barrier and the security status of other traffic routes. The dagger for interrogation was useless, and it was more time-consuming to appease the Demon Mask that was nagging at us to show its blood than to interrogate it.</p>

<p>"So you're going to attack the fort with this many men?</p>

<p>The three members of Justan's escort team, two cavalrymen, and an imperial knight made up the six combatants present. The cavalrymen looked up to the sky as if they were clinging to the heavens, but all they could see were leafy branches. The reality was merciless. Justin did not intend to let the fort fall by launching a white arm battle. Walm understood the desired role of the small-arms firearm.</p>

<p>“First move, burn it down.”</p>

<p>“It's the most effective move, despite the ...... hassle.”</p>

<p>Unusually, Justan exerts the imperial knight. He has wielded “Demon Fire” against military targets. That's fine. It is the soldiers who are killed and murdered. The reason for Walm's conflict was that that fort was coupled with a settlement of flattened mountainous terrain. He knew what would happen if he burned the fort. But he still had to do it. Walm tried to keep his composure as he pushed aside the conflict in his heart.</p>

<p>"When you reach the fort through the slope, use Demon Fire to burn it down. I don't need a signal. We'll match it."</p>

<p>"The foundation is stone, and the wood is covered with clay and plaster. Demon Fire will not be able to burn it down.</p>

<p>Even if some of the upper parts are made of wood, the foundation is made of stone, and it would be extremely difficult to burn it down even with Demon Fire.</p>

<p>"Don't worry. We will open the gate."</p>

<p>"Yes!　You want me to open the gate while being roasted by blue flames?</p>

<p>“Hey, you're lying. ......”</p>

<p>The cavalrymen, who correctly understood the meaning of what Justan had told them, were absolutely stunned.</p>

<p>“If you don't get a direct hit, the magic membrane will prevent it.”</p>

<p>The former Kingsguard who had planned the operation said simply, "If it's not a direct hit, the magic membrane can prevent it. However, it is also true that he was somewhat desperate. There is no other effective way. Those who understood the finite nature of time stopped protesting further.</p>

<p>"I'll leave Douglas and the others to stay behind. As soon as the gate is open, we'll tow the horses through. If you fail, turn back to Refn."</p>

<p>“They'll run off without a second glance, sir.”</p>

<p>"The cavalrymen will help you go in with me. Tie all the extra stuff to the horses. You'll be lighter, and you don't want to burn your stuff."</p>

<p>The cavalrymen, having given up on the idea, began hurriedly tying their baggage to their horses. Walm, too, shoved his bulky axe spear into his magic bag. It was a peculiar sensation that he would never get used to, as if it would disappear from his wrists onward.</p>

<p>“May I have a word with you, Maia?”</p>

<p>The former Kingsguard calls out to Maia in a gentle tone that is a complete change from the rough tone he used to use with the soldiers. The cavalryman's dissatisfaction grew even higher when he asked to be treated equally by both sexes.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p>“Could you please make mud with water magic, I want to use it for disguise and fireproofing.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to me.”</p>

<p>Maia nodded vigorously and kneaded the ground and water with water magic to create mud. In short, she wants us to continue to cover our bodies with mud and prevent fire as we did in the mining town.</p>

<p>“We're going to get covered in mud again?”</p>

<p>“We're not mad boars!”</p>

<p>The cavalrymen were outraged, but their commander was taking the initiative in applying mud on top of mud. They could not refuse. Walm spoke softly to the cavalrymen who reluctantly scooped up the mud.</p>

<p>“I'm glad you have a friend to play with fire.”</p>

<p>“You damned knight!”</p>

<p>“Highserk, you son of a bitch.”</p>

<p>Warm words that softened the mood. The cavalier's words must have touched a chord in his heart. Maia's special mud is thrown at them as a thank-you or as feces. Walm laments, "I don't understand. The human heart is a difficult thing to understand.</p>

<p>At the moment, he had taken all possible measures. Justan squares his jaw sarcastically. With a grateful send-off, Walm ducked down the slope and began to advance. First on his knees, then on all fours like a baby as the distance closed in. Justin and the other knights must be watching the imperial knight crawl like a mommy and daddy. The slight swaying of the leaves seemed to be growing very large.</p>

<p>The moisture from the grass and trees rubs against his body, moistening Walm's clothes through his armor. The sentinels guarding the gate were engaged in idle chatter. Complaining about the food and fodder on offer, speculating about the uncertainties of the war, Walm sincerely hoped that their chatter would be endless.</p>

<p>The soles of their shoes echoed ahead of them as they continued to crawl, as if they were throwing out their limbs. A sentinel on the ramparts looked over the breastworks at the slope. On his arm hangs the united mark of the Yalukuk militia. They keep their bodies as close to the ground as possible, not willing to get their cheeks dirty. It was like a rat digging in the ground. Ten or twenty seconds pass, and the footsteps of the sentinel, perhaps satisfied with the unchanging landscape, move away.</p>

<p>Walm flicked a clinging winged insect with his finger and resumed his advance, elbows, knees, and hips working in tandem. The sluggishness of the slugs even threw off his sense of time. Despite his slow movements, his body was aflame with tension and a heightened sense of nerve.</p>

<p>Walm finally reached his target. He set the Demon Mask on a special seat and checked the condition of his stiffened limbs. The timing was left to him. After taking a breath or two, Walm ran up the slope and scrambled up the ramparts, which were as tall as a man. He peeked into the passageway using the breastworks as a foothold, and saw a soldier. His gaze, which had been staring off into the distance, senses something unusual and slides aside.</p>

<p>“Ah--”</p>

<p>He was not prepared for the Highserk soldier facing him. The blade of the longsword he carried drawn shook. Walm rushed forward with the statue-like stillness of the Yarkuk territorial soldier in his sights. What had been a man fell down from the passageway. A dull thud, a dull fall, and all eyes in the castle are on them at once.</p>

<p>“Intruder!”</p>

<p>One of the sentinels holds up a short spear and a shield to block the way. There was no time to waste. Walm jumped in regardless. He deflected the tip of the spear, which was blocking his approach, with the belly of his sword, and struck the corner of the raised shield with his longsword. The edge is cut off by a “hard blow,” and the hidden vital point is cut off. Without checking the result, Walm slips through the small side.</p>

<p>"On the slope side, enemy soldiers!　Single horsemen run!"</p>

<p>The archers in the watchtower caught sight of Walm late. His agile movements before he plunged his arrow into the air showed the training he must have received on a daily basis. Walm kept his feet on the ground as he stared at the arrow's flight. An arrowhead pierced his back and his feet. The aim was off Walm.</p>

<p>"Damn, the angle. I can't shoot anymore."</p>

<p>"It's in at my feet. Don't let it climb."</p>

<p>It is not clear if he missed the target or if he released it as a check. However, the archers missed their best opportunity. After all, the game was already decided when they dived into the tower. Walm rushed directly under the watchtower and unleashed Demon Fire.</p>

<p>Flames overflowed from the beams and floorboards, creating azure petals. Immediately afterward, the wooden corridor, which had received the full force of the blast, blew up with a roar. The archers slid down to the ground in the falling sparks of fire. The bonfire of people made the success of the assault known to both sides, whether they liked it or not.</p>

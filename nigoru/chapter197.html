<p>Episode 43</p>

<p>The twin moons that sat in the night sky lit up Orsellica Hill pale blue, as if the distinction between day and night was too bothersome. The moonlight brings shadows to the surface and reveals those who are stirring on the ground. Myard's soldiers, who guarded the cut-through, were busy moving back and forth from place to place. Moyes, a member of the Deborah Company defending a section of the Rokkou in Celta, traverses the plain inside the earthen mound.</p>

<p>Just three days earlier, the Royal Army of Craist had failed in a major offensive, inflicting heavy casualties on its generals. The reserve force that had been waiting on the plain immediately attempted to regroup, but the company of soldiers, using the shock power that they lacked due to the confusion and fear of the defeated soldiers, pushed through to the plain. The visual intimidation of the burnt-out soldiers and Demon Fire brought more results than they could have imagined.</p>

<p>The enemy, including reserves, lost 400 men killed or wounded. The company of the paratroopers, which had bought some time for the retreating Craist militia, did not have time to rest. The company had to make numerous construction works, such as reclaiming the road, removing the mounds, and repairing the earthworks. On the contrary, three days had passed since the collision, and the disposal of the dead bodies was just about finished. Bodies were scattered all along the cut. The cause of death varied from burnt and shriveled corpses to those so neat and clean that they could hardly be considered dead. The soldiers were scrambling to dispose of them.</p>

<p>"Hey, don't let go of my hand so suddenly!</p>

<p>"I didn't take my hand off. I got it."</p>

<p>One of the two men engaged in transporting the corpses reprimanded him. In response, the soldier who had been blamed frowned as he held out his hand. His arm, shredded from the elbow down, dangled and shook. Moyes realized what had happened. The ligaments and muscles that joined the limbs had been scorched by the raging flames and could not bear the weight of their own bodies during the transport.</p>

<p>"Ha, how long are you going to shake hands with that guy? Grab his side, we're going to carry him quickly."</p>

<p>“I know.”</p>

<p>The older soldier who was holding the leg urged his partner to spare no time. He rested his arm on his chest and inserted his hand into his side. The unfortunate recruit, now closer to the dead, swore and calmed himself down.</p>

<p>"What a hassle. Why don't you just throw them off the cut bank?"</p>

<p>"If you throw them off the cut bank, the wind will carry them away and they'll stink all day long. Besides, they say it's more demoralizing to bury them in their path.</p>

<p>"So that's how it is. I hate war."</p>

<p>They grumbled, but resumed their hauling. It was not an act to be blamed. Moyes avoided their waddling path and headed for the main fortress. A ridge path extended through the earthwork camp, overlooking the enemy who had passed through the cut-through. This was the last gateway to the outpost, and at the same time, it served as a place to accumulate men and supplies.</p>

<p>In one corner of the permanent barracks, a series of high piles of armaments were stacked in a heap. The weapons were stripped from enemy soldiers, and the unlucky ones ordered to sort them out wiped off the stubbornly stuck flesh and blood with dirt and oil. Unlike the duo I saw earlier, they were single-mindedly devoted to maintenance.</p>

<p>“No wonder, huh?”</p>

<p>The auspicious attitude was probably due to the proximity of the frontline command post. It would be a matter of life and death if Deborah, the head instructor, who is also his mother and in charge of the training company in the tent, found him complaining. She would slap him on the buttocks and bruise him, saying, "Don't let a man whine. Moyes had experienced this since he was a child, and there was no doubt about it.</p>

<p>After straightening up his clothes and gear, and brushing the dirt from his eyes, Moyes stopped in front of one of the tents. At the entrance, the guards and soldiers on duty saluted him. After returning the salute, Moyes asks the sentry.</p>

<p>“Is the company commander here?”</p>

<p>Yes, sir, he's inside with Platoon Leader Yorgim.</p>

<p>The sentry hangs his hand over the entrance to the tent and invites Moyse to join him. The room is illuminated by a lamp made of Japanese hibiscus. A small desk was piled with maps and directives, and behind it were the members of the immediate family, who were frowning with some difficulty.</p>

<p>“Platoon Commander Moyes, you have reported in.”</p>

<p>"You've come well. What are the results of your reconnaissance?"</p>

<p>"Most of the enemy has dropped off the slope of Orserica Hill and is regrouping. On the way there and back, we had a battle with a small group and two of us were wounded, except for the one who had his arm broken, but he is able to return to the front."</p>

<p>The mission given to us was a good one. There were no fatalities, although there were some wounded.</p>

<p>"So they have fallen back. It would have been nice if they had remained calm."</p>

<p>"You know, I wouldn't get my hopes up too high. Moyes, you did good."</p>

<p>It was like being praised by a toddler who had just waddled for the first time. Moyes shook his head, itching at the disproportionate praise.</p>

<p>"It's the chief guardian of Walm's handiwork. If I hadn't accompanied him, several people would have died."</p>

<p>Although they had gained some experience, Moyes and the soldiers under his command were still newcomers. It was only by relying on their personal skills and experience that they were able to bring them home without missing a beat on a battlefield where anything could happen.</p>

<p>"Too much modesty is arrogance. It's better than ...... overconfidence, but a commander has to be ready to smile in the face of death."</p>

<p>“I understand, I do.”</p>

<p>If I could do that, I wouldn't have a hard time. How could I be so cowardly to my parents, who were as courageous as a rock? I am deeply grateful for their advice as a commander and a parent. But at the same time, my heart is inexplicably closed. After being given a plan for the future, Moyes is about to leave the tent with a commonplace banter.</p>

<p>“Then I will return to my post.”</p>

<p>"Wait, Moyse. Take the barrels outside with you on your way back."</p>

<p>Moyes, searching his memory, guessed the contents and asked.</p>

<p>“Drinking water, is it?”</p>

<p>"Yes, it's liquor. It was given to me by the great lady in recognition of my war achievements. Drink it gratefully with your men.</p>

<p>Don't drink too much. You can't fight a war if you're unsteady on your feet."</p>

<p>My parents, whose foreheads had recently been wrinkled, smiled and said.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I'll take it.”</p>

<p>Moyes took a small gulp of air as he stepped out of the tent. The cool air felt good on his burning body. A superior and a subordinate, what a strange father-son relationship. Still, he could not dislike this relationship.</p>

<p>"The barrels are over there. Please arrange for a wheelbarrow."</p>

<p>Guided by the duty officer, Moyes stood in front of the barrels of liquor and pondered. With a nimble poke once or twice, the contents would shake.</p>

<p>“This much is enough for my hands.”</p>

<p>"That was a foolish question for the son of the head instructor. Excuse me."</p>

<p>The soldier on duty probably has no bad intentions. After all, she is a dynamic mother. She must be complimenting him. But Moyes, unable to accept such compliments, is a bit torn. He shakes off his illusions and says, "Don't think nonsense. As he stretches out his arm to lift him up, his troops leap into the corner of his eye.</p>

<p>“Gaston, Evrakh!”</p>

<p>The two of them froze as if they had just been called out by a superior officer. Being stopped near the front line command post is a bonus. They were probably thinking that they were ill-dressed or on a reconnaissance mission. Their equipment was dirty and their clothes were disheveled from the daily battles they had experienced. Fatigue was evident on their faces, but only their eyes were glazed over. Moyes, who knew them before, felt that they were dependable, despite their outward appearance.</p>

<p>“Platoon leader, you wanted to see me?”</p>

<p>“Since you are harassing us again in small numbers?”</p>

<p>This is what I call resignation, and I was bracing myself for what kind of impossible task they would come up with. It is a sad habit of the handyman infantry. Moyes' mischievous spirit danced in the air, thinking that a surprise was not such a bad idea.</p>

<p>"We're going to bring a barrel into our position.</p>

<p>“That heavy-looking barrel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we can't take it on our own.”</p>

<p>The two men make noises without even touching it. Moyes did not pursue the matter further.</p>

<p>“Well, that's too bad.”</p>

<p>Evraak senses the discomfort and stares at the cask as he says these meaningful words.</p>

<p>"You can't be serious, this is wine!</p>

<p>"Wine?</p>

<p>Sniffing the faint aroma of the spirit of wine like hounds, the two, their eyes shining brightly, snuggle into the barrel.</p>

<p>“Heh, heh, it's filled to the brim.”</p>

<p>“We can drink it at the camp, can't we!”</p>

<p>“Of course, it's for us, it's our drink.”</p>

<p>Gaston hugged the cask, determined never to let it go again, and Evrak, though dizzy, took the two of them to carry it up. Their movements were more forceful than any he had shown during the general contracting work. Moyes, who was laughing at the flip-flop, stood at the head of them and called out to the soldiers stationed in the camp. This kind of advance team would not be a bad idea.</p>

<p>"Platoon members, assemble. A bottle of wine has arrived from Grand Duke Rita Myard."</p>

<p>"Wine?　Hey, it's wine!</p>

<p>"Wine?</p>

<p>It wasn't very loud, but no one could hear it. Those who had been sleeping jumped up in a frenzy and accidentally put on their comrades-in-arms' half boots. The platoon rallied to worship Moyes and his keg. In other words, they were like domesticated dogs waiting to be fed. They were eagerly awaiting the moment, and their patience was short-lived. They all had cups in their hands.</p>

<p>"You're all here. Don't skimp. Anyone who drinks a third cup will be ordered to do hard labor."</p>

<p>The reply came back with an upbeat tone. I'm sure that by the time they finish their drinks, they will start snitching on each other, saying that he had had his third drink.</p>

<p>“Rita-sama is so generous!”</p>

<p>“Where's the pouring hole?”</p>

<p>“Where's the pouring hole?” "Idiot, it'll be morning. Take the top off and stick it in the cup, there won't be any left anyway.</p>

<p>Come on, open it.</p>

<p>Come on. - Don't be in a hurry.</p>

<p>Gaston put his weight on the handle of the knife and pried the top off. The smell of the sobbing liquor spread throughout the room, and it was greeted with a jubilant clang of armor. The cups jabbed competitively, making a clattering crash sound.</p>

<p>“Don't spill it, idiot!”</p>

<p>Don't push me," he said.</p>

<p>Don't spill it!“ ”You're the one who should stop pushing it!“ ”The drink won't run away from you!"</p>

<p>Moyes complains about the madness of the situation, and the soldier denies it with the same force with which he poured the wine.</p>

<p>"Platoon leader, the liquor won't run away, but it will run out!</p>

<p>Pulling out what little food they had, the soldiers sat down on the ground and began to feast. A mixture of bad dancing and out-of-tune singing. They are doing a fine job in the madness of war. But what about themselves? Are they doing everything they can, or are they not deceiving the people with whom they have shared their hardships and joys? Moyes poured down a glass of alcohol to cover up the shame that welled up inside him.</p>

<p>The emotions he had been suppressing came to the surface. His arms and legs were aching. Fatigue and sleep deprivation robbed him of his petty reason. His mind is unable to process the discrepancy between the sense of disgust and the sense of helplessness, even though he has killed a person. The chief guard's words may be true: "You get used to that kind of experience if you go through it day after day. In fact, the soldiers are handling the corpses they have been turning away from day in and day out, complaining about it. They have become accustomed to death and their senses have become numb. Moyes does not know whether this is good or bad.</p>

<p>“I was numb to that thing three days ago, wasn't I?”</p>

<p>“No way, a hundred people burned to death,” he said.</p>

<p>“I didn't get out of there in time, but I would have been dead if it hadn't been for the chief guard.”</p>

<p>The soldiers, who had been delighted by the sake, naturally shifted their conversation to the familiar topic of war.</p>

<p>"He's scary, but he's dependable. Sometimes when I talk to him, I wonder if he's really the same person he was when he was fighting."</p>

<p>The soldiers around the barrel nodded at the tipsy Evrak's words.</p>

<p>"I know. When we were scouting today, we killed three of them in the blink of an eye."</p>

<p>“I had a little leak when the head rolled over my feet.”</p>

<p>Moyes agreed, with a different kind of fierceness. It was a far cry from the imperial knight, dear and awe-inspiring at the same time, the way he looked around the house and around the dinner table.</p>

<p>“Well, those Craist bastards haven't attacked us properly since then,” he said.</p>

<p>"Five of the enemy's centurions are in a state of destruction, and even their successors must be shying away from the idea. We can't even form a dense formation.</p>

<p>"We have a guard commander and an instructor. Even Platoon Leader Moyes can blow a few guys away with one swing.</p>

<p>“That's not bad.”</p>

<p>Gaston praised me with a big smile. There was unquestioning trust in his words. Moyes smiles a strong smile as his throat twitches, as if he refuses to speak. He is bluffing, but his immediate family sees through him somehow. Dandurg was more at ease. Despite the responsibility that befell him, and the fact that he was in a position to blast his subordinates, he had yet to kill anyone with a clear intent to do so. He pretended to be brave and used a big swing to fool the others, but there was no way he could keep doing that. If it is a demon that destroys crops, we have exterminated it. But when it turns into a human being, his hands inevitably become dull. No matter how he tried to make things right, it was an act of disobedience to his subordinates, who were doing their best to die.</p>

<p>“Speaking of which, where is the chief guardian?”</p>

<p>“I think I saw him at the cliff.”</p>

<p>"Keep drinking. I'll go get the chief protector a drink."</p>

<p>Moyes, with two cups in his hands, leaves the circle with his hair in his back. The imperial knight stands on a precipice created by a ridge, directly opposite the cut bank. No one was around to offer help, and only purple smoke drifted in the air around them.</p>

<p>"Lord Protector, there you are. Here is a drink from Grand Duke Rita."</p>

<p>"You took the trouble to prepare it for me. Thank you."</p>

<p>His expression was soft. It was hard to believe that he was a knight who was nonchalantly choking the enemy soldiers. Seeing Walm bring the drink to his lips, Moyes also tipped his cup. A sweetness spreads in the mouth, followed by a rough astringency. I could feel the hot liquid flowing down my esophagus and into my stomach. After a few more drinks, Moyes asked, under the influence of the spirit of alcohol, if he had slipped up. It is no exaggeration to say that he slipped up.</p>

<p>“How can I kill my enemies like the chief guardian?”</p>

<p>The uninterrupted conversation stopped. After foolishly uttering the words, regret filled me. Fearfully, I looked into the face of the imperial knight, his eyes as murky as darkness, still staring at the empty sky.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry, I misspoke.”</p>

<p>"...... No, don't worry about it. I know you're worried. I had a superior officer at the time give me advice and tell me my duty as a soldier when I was first on the battlefield."</p>

<p>I couldn't imagine this knight as a recruit, but he was the same person. He may have conflicts and fears that he does not show to others. The chief guardian cut off his words once and slowly continued. It was as if he was reminding himself.</p>

<p>"Surprisingly, there are many who cannot kill because of resistance to killing their own kind. But if you can't kill, that enemy will kill not only your life, but also your comrades-in-arms, and then your unit and your hometown. When you weigh your life in the balance and still hesitate, remember that, right?"</p>

<p>I let out a small breath. The words repeated themselves in my mind. They strike Moyes now, and at the same time, they convey the feelings of his superiors at the time, who would have been concerned about Walm.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm just taking someone's word for it. Do you have any idea what disrupts the movement?"</p>

<p>“...... I don't know.”</p>

<p>No matter how much I twisted and turned, my liquor-soaked brain could not come up with an answer. As if to guide Moyes, who was looking down and pondering, the knight threw in a few words.</p>

<p>“Is it something you were born with, someone else's influence, or a childhood experience?”</p>

<p>Even though they were from the same peasant background, the chief patron was truly knowledgeable. As if in a fever, he mimicked and repeated the words. There was an answer in his closed memory.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. When I was little, the neighborhood brats played with each other. It was with a stick or my bare hands. ...... I thought I was holding back. But the arm of the kid I was playing with broke from the elbow, and I still clearly remember the scream and the bone sticking out."</p>

<p>Since then, Moyes has never played with anyone his own age.</p>

<p>"The mind hurts as much as the body. The bigger it is, the more it remains as a wound that cannot be healed. I guess you could call it psychological trauma."</p>

<p>"The guardian-in-chief is a poet, yes. So, is there a solution?"</p>

<p>Moyes asked as he clutched at her, and the imperial knight scratched his head with the most annoyed look of the day.</p>

<p>"That's what ...... I don't know either. Sometimes time solves it, sometimes circumstances make you overcome it. I'm sorry to disappoint you."</p>

<p>“I was about to worship the chief guardian for the rest of my life if this healed the psychological trauma and all that.”</p>

<p>"That's too bad. Well, so much for the tale of woe. I'm here to thank you for the sake. Can I smoke?"</p>

<p>He was offered a cigarette. Moyes accepted it, held it up to the moon, and exclaimed in admiration.</p>

<p>“This is a fine one, isn't it?”</p>

<p>The leaves were carefully rolled without gaps, and even Moyes, who has no smoking habit, could tell that they were not inferior soldier cigarettes.</p>

<p>“I got it from a cavalry battalion commander in the imperial capital.”</p>

<p>The serious tone of his voice makes him laugh even harder. Moyes can't resist and lets the words slip out. He utters the words that Myard people often speak to their neighbors.</p>

<p>“Ha ha ha, this is why Highserk people.”</p>

<p>Despite the lack of courtesy, the knight showed his teeth in amusement. It did not mean that he had solved the problems he was having. Still, I felt strangely relieved.</p>

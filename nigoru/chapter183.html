<p>Episode 30</p>

<p>The world reflected in her eyes was distorted as if it were curved. His limp legs refused to walk over even the slightest of bumps, as if he were on steep terrain. The word “wounded” is an understatement; Makoto's appearance was terrible. His left arm was ruptured by the outburst of a heavy bomb. From the elbow onward, it was blown away, and the remaining part of his body was lost up to the shoulder. The incomplete magical membrane alone was unable to catch the aftermath, and burns and lacerations consumed his entire body.</p>

<p>"Look closely. It's me."</p>

<p>Makoto, who had been walking with the gait of a wraith, lazily called out into the darkness. A shadow that had been hidden in the dimness appeared.</p>

<p>"I am surprised. I didn't know you were alive after that explosion."</p>

<p>It was one of the Reharzen Knights who had participated in the attack. He is not happy to see us again, but his demeanor is very clerical. There was a girl with her arms torn off and her whole body sore, and not even a single word of encouragement. It was very much like the Knights of Reharzen.</p>

<p>"The mud became a buffer. The corpses in the mud were good decoys, too.</p>

<p>"There is a healing magician among the assistants waiting at the rendezvous point. Please wait a moment."</p>

<p>The knight disappeared into the darkness again. Sitting up, Makoto stretched out his ship's arms, unable to bear the dull pain. He probed his side and found a sharp white piece of shrapnel sticking out of his side.</p>

<p>“あの放火魔、僕を、傷物にしてっ、くれ、たな”</p>

<p>I don't even know where, but it's a piece of ruptured bone. My vision narrowed and swayed from side to side due to excessive bleeding. Makoto was about to let go of his consciousness when he was struck on the cheek, blinding him.</p>

<p>“Ouch, that hurt.”</p>

<p>The knight of Reharzen, staring at the lackey with half-open eyes and heavy lids, declared without a hint of apology.</p>

<p>"Don't skip consciousness. If the magical membrane is broken, you will die from bleeding and pain. Talk to me until the wound is closed."</p>

<p>“Talking under these circumstances?”</p>

<p>Whether it's the knights of the empire who like to play with fire or the knights of the kingdom who lack emotion, they all have a screw loose in their heads. Mako began to flee, needing screwdrivers and wrenches first, rather than civilization and culture.</p>

<p>“What happened to the end of your shoulder?”</p>

<p>"From the elbow forward, it was shredded and no good, no good. The front of the shoulder couldn't withstand the magic, and it popped off."</p>

<p>It was only a fake. The price to pay for that was the explosion. It was a stepping stone to escape from the 《Demon Fire》 user who was dazzled by the flash, but to be forced to run away in defeat with one arm as bait, Mako taunted himself that he was no different from a creature that cuts itself in the tail and arm parts.</p>

<p>"Is it a piece of wood? If that's the case, it's impossible to join them."</p>

<p>The knight of Reharzen, who gave instructions to the accompanying healer-magician, changed the subject.</p>

<p>“I'm afraid you'll have to abide by Commander Gran's strict order not to go too deep.”</p>

<p>"I know, I know. I was greedy. But, you guys say that?"</p>

<p>“I'm sorry to hear about that.”</p>

<p>Despite his words, the knight of Reharzen was disgustingly unconcerned. As a result of the abominable past knight commanders' training, this knight order has little value for life, both its own and others'. Even if a comrade-in-arms dies, it is a recognition of the loss of the knighthood and the nation's strength. This knight is still a better classification, with the exception of Johanna and a few others, who see people not as individuals but as numbers. In fact, excluding auxiliary personnel, the number of remaining soldiers who participated in the attack could be counted on one hand. While he laments the losses, he does not mourn the individuals.</p>

<p>“Gran, bother.”</p>

<p>"It's Gran-sama. Makoto-sama. You are right, one of the goals of this operation, the blockade of the Refun mine and the mountain castle, has been achieved."</p>

<p>"I should have just left the gun and run away. What the hell is that guy? He's worse than the last one."</p>

<p>“Yes, we were greedy, too.”</p>

<p>It seems that even the knights of Reharzen, who have remarkably low empathy, were almost wiped out by the aftermath of the Demon Fire, which was extremely painful. Rarely did their emotions match.</p>

<p>"Hah, ah, the real work is just beginning, isn't it? If we die in the preliminaries, there's nothing to take care of, right?"</p>

<p>◆ ◆</p>

<p>The Lehun Mine is a place of constant strife because of its value, and a mountain fortress was built to ensure that the mine would be well governed. The castle, which would also serve as a strategic location in the event of an emergency, was filled one after another with people who had been hit by mudslides in the mining town and its downstream areas.</p>

<p>Two days had passed since the battle, but the team of healers and magicians were busy saving lives, and Justin, who was in charge of the escort, was also engaged in discussions with the local garrison and the territory of Celta. Walm, who had experienced many battlefields, was more worn out in mind and body than usual. Perhaps it was because he had burned Ayane's childhood friend and fellow countryman, Makoto. He smoked a purple flame in the short break given by Justan and piled up the cigarette butts, but could not come to a conclusion.</p>

<p>"I've killed countless people in my life. What's the matter with you now, it's just one more person."</p>

<p>Inhaling bitter white smoke in a corner of the unpopular castle walls, he asks himself, but it doesn't make sense.</p>

<p>"Self-defense, justifiable homicide ......? is sophistry. Whatever it is, it's still killing."</p>

<p>Most problematic is that he has not been able to tell Ayane the facts, citing his busy schedule.</p>

<p>“At some point, I'll have to tell her.”</p>

<p>The difference between late and early. In theory, it was obvious, but detaching yourself from your feelings is something you never get used to, no matter how old you get. The sound of footsteps of sentries patrolling the castle walls interrupted my thoughts.</p>

<p>I am caught by the sound and look up to see a small patch of sky cut off at the corner of the ramparts. It is a cloudless blue sky. With a sigh, white smoke billows out, polluting the pristine sky. He has reached the limit of his escapism. Walm is beginning to give up, when he notices a sudden change in the flow of people with a sudden bustle.</p>

<p>“What happened this time?”</p>

<p>Inside the castle, soldiers were running around, and information was being passed back and forth quickly. It was certain that this was no ordinary event, but there was no sound of battle and no smell of blood. The fact that the Demon Mask, which is sensitive to bloodshed, remained silent, made it clear that it was not a surprise attack. Walm stepped out of the cigarette with the sole of his shoe and took a short run. He then rushes to his post, the treatment area, and looks for a familiar face in the attached guest room. Among the mass of people arguing in the room, there was an escort from Highserk.</p>

<p>“Douglas, what happened?”</p>

<p>A bitter face, I knew the moment I turned to face him that it was not a good thing as far as I was concerned.</p>

<p>“In ...... Yarkuk, there was an armed uprising by forces claiming to be from the former Kingdom of Felius' army.”</p>

<p>Walm searches his memory. It was a small town located between Lehun and Celta. Although the area was classified as part of the former Kingdom of Felius, it was now incorporated into Myard, and the uprising would have left it isolated and helpless. It would be a short-lived uprising, and the only thing that could be done was to overrun the city. The problem was that it was obvious to everyone that the uprising was in response to the attack on the Refn mine. The Kingdom of Craist must be behind this.</p>

<p>"Urgent report, urgent report!</p>

<p>It was Justan, who had been working in the communication station equipped with communication equipment every day, who shouted the urgent news as he entered the room.</p>

<p>“If it's the Yarkık uprising, it's already--”</p>

<p>Alas, the communication was not going well. Walm tried to state that the uprising in Yarkuk had already been communicated, but Justan denied it, covering his words.</p>

<p>"No, it is not. There have been uprisings in Balboaad and Ranaisfiya."</p>

<p>“No way, near the provisional border with Craist!”</p>

<p>The news was even more troubling than Yarkuk. A rebellion in a border war with a neighboring country would lead to the intervention of other countries. Therefore, it must be quickly and thoroughly suppressed.</p>

<p>"The main road to Refun is blocked. Can Celta's army handle it alone?"</p>

<p>The mountain fortresses that dominate the area have been transformed into isolated islands on land, as have the mines. Although it has no lasting power, various types of attribute magic can instantaneously demonstrate a work capacity comparable to heavy machinery. The problem would be solved if viewed on a monthly basis, but at present, the two battalions that are the garrisons of the Refun area are rotting.</p>

<p>“It would be possible to do it with just a standing garrison, but the defense would be too thin.”</p>

<p>Justan's concern was valid. Although Celta has a large number of soldiers, not all of them are standing troops. The number of troops that can respond immediately is limited.</p>

<p>"The Highserk Imperial Army stationed in Celta will also be deployed. All together, it should be the size of a battalion."</p>

<p>Douglas, who is well connected to the Imperial Guard, raised one of the forces. The unit was dispatched as a symbol of the alliance's ties. It was one of the best in the Imperial Army, which was struggling to manage its forces. And there is no one better qualified than the Highserk Imperial Guard to play the hated role in the field. Walm's face turned sullen as he thought that he could serve as both a candy and a whip. The group was discussing the issue, but they were interrupted by a call that was so loud it was almost piercing.</p>

<p>"Where is Master Justan?</p>

<p>“Here!”</p>

<p>Justan answered without a moment's pause. The messenger, who had found the man he was looking for, was out of breath and about to begin his report.</p>

<p>"A follow-up report. One or two breaths and then speak."</p>

<p>You can see his chest expand with his breathing. The messenger, who has taken in enough oxygen, rolls up as if a weir has been broken.</p>

<p>“Command in Celta has given strict orders for Ayane-sama and the convoy to return immediately.”</p>

<p>"Understood. We'll begin withdrawing immediately. So - is there anything more?"</p>

<p>It is standard practice to place healing magicians near the front lines before the suppression begins. It was appropriate that they be recalled. Walm waits for the words that follow.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, the Kingdom of Craist and the Liberitoa Trade Federation have declared war on the Duchy of ...... Myard. War, war is coming!"</p>

<p>Justin's expression shifted from puzzled to upset to angry, and he questioned the messenger about the details. Other soldiers asked questions in rapid succession. It was a situation that could be called a frenzy. Walm, who had strayed from the circle, repeated to himself, "I've killed so many people.</p>

<p>“...... even though I killed so many and was killed.”</p>

<p>The smoldering fires, the unsettled situation, the clashes under the surface. At some point, somewhere, there will be a major clash. His experience as a military man had sounded the alarm bells. Still, it would be good if the countries spent their military resources on the removal and restoration of the demon territory, and the state of moderate tension continued. Walm hoped so. But what he was told to refuse was a declaration of war.</p>

<p>"After all, have you learned nothing? Is the hegemony of the northern countries so attractive to you? ...... All that will be left is rubble and corpses."</p>

<p>The throne of the Hegemony is erected over countless corpses. The peace of the people has crumbled, and after two years of preparation called peace, the war that divided the Northern States has begun again.</p>

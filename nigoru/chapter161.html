<p>Episode 8 
Blood seeps from a severed mouth and the bitter taste of iron spreads. Hayes' arm is unable to grasp anything, and the family member at the end of his outstretched arm has vanished due to multiple attack magics. His own right arm also suffered numerous lacerations, but they were only abrasions compared to the lethal attack his youngest brother would have suffered.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking? Do you want to die, Hayes?"</p>

<p>Hayes rejected his friend soldier who rushed into the room. It would have been better if he had been forced to drink the vomit of a domestic animal. While suppressing the sour taste that rises in him, he shouts the name of the underling who has carved countless wounds in the earth.</p>

<p>“Riiiightiaaaaah!”</p>

<p>“Ah, ah!”</p>

<p>Running her bloodshot eyes, she finds the former adventurer naturalized in Liberitoa. The girl's shoulders shook with agitation as she crowded closer. Hayes is about to grab her by the chest, but the man interrupts him. No need to check. It was Lefty, another former adventurer.</p>

<p>"Get out of there, Lefty!　Don't protect her just because she's your girl!"</p>

<p>"Be cool, Hayes. Besides, I'm the one who gave the order."</p>

<p>Despite what he said, it didn't matter if Lefty was protecting Leethia or not. Hayes was still conversing with his brother. Walm had a stubborn streak, but he was essentially an understanding and conscientious person. Reconciliation might still be possible.</p>

<p>"I was still talking to my brother, why!　He got up from his seat trying to calm down, trying to sort out his feelings!　Why did he set me up?"</p>

<p>"That's why. If he regained his composure and looked around, he was in danger of being detected. Captain Hayes, you don't know what your brother looks like on the battlefield. If we let that thing get away, how much damage could it do? If we lose one of the pillars, Highserk will suffer fewer casualties as a result."</p>

<p>“You're just making a mess of things - tell me the truth, it's not a personal grudge against your brothers for conquering your hometown.”</p>

<p>I question the two former adventurers, but Leethia just looks down. Lefty, who is not very expressive to begin with, does not even waver in his expression.</p>

<p>"You're going to kill each other. Calm down, you have a family."</p>

<p>Lefty restrains Hayes as if admonishing him. He grinds his teeth and kicks the ground in a fit of impulse.</p>

<p>"Yeah, there, my family was there a minute ago. Oh, shit. Satisfaction, or let me abandon my family, for my family's sake!!!!"</p>

<p>While Hayes rages, Liberitoa soldiers scattered around the perimeter are on guard and working to collect the bodies. They were the elite 30 men selected from the home country to kill his brother in case the negotiations failed. An effective route of progress to the outskirts of the capital had not yet been secured. Given the current situation where it is difficult for a large force to cross the border, it can be said that the burn-faced foreign minister selected the best people to kill his brother.</p>

<p>“Any damage?”</p>

<p>"None. The luring fire of the underworld is also a stupefying thing."</p>

<p>“Demon Fire users are mere mortals in front of their brothers.”</p>

<p>The group even included one who had once engaged his brother in direct combat. Hayes silenced the chirping soldiers with a glance, but suddenly he felt dizzy and his vision narrowed. His footing was as shaky as if he were standing in a quagmire. How had it come to this? Perhaps he had not paid enough attention to his brother, or perhaps he had not been trusted as an older brother in the first place. Haze repeated short breaths, but the soldiers who were searching the surroundings suddenly became noisy and let out a word that could not be overlooked.</p>

<p>“There was a dead body. ...... Hey, it's still alive!”</p>

<p>“Hurry up and put an end to it!”</p>

<p>Hayes said as he drew his sword without making a sound.</p>

<p>"Stop, I'll drag you back to Liberitoa. Where is the healer? The wound--"</p>

<p>The air around him instantly cooled at the murderous act. A man steps out from among the soldiers who stand frozen in place. It is Howard, one of the Liberitoa soldiers who saved Hayes at the border. He was a member of the company commanded by Hayes, who was engaged in scraping off the demon territory, and they had saved each other's lives many times.</p>

<p>"Hayes, I know how you feel, but I can't help you even if I'm your brother. That would be a violation of orders. Besides, take a good look."</p>

<p>He turns to his brother, who has been thrown to the ground. His sturdy armor had saved him from instant death. But his appearance is nothing short of tragic. His entire body had been carved by the “wind fangs,” and his life was leaking out onto the earth. His limbs were broken unnaturally like dead trees, and there were no intact limbs left. The irregularly bulging chest suggests that the heart and lungs are not functioning properly.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, but you must be prepared. It's a fatal wound. It's not a wound that can be saved."</p>

<p>I don't need Howard to tell me that. His experience on the battlefield as a soldier warns him that his brother has no chance of survival. As if to make matters worse, Lefty calls his name.</p>

<p>“...... Hayes.”</p>

<p>"Argh, I know. I know!　Brother, what the hell. So I'll do it."</p>

<p>He sits down on his knees beside his prone brother, clutching his drawn sword. He looks like a penitent sinner begging for forgiveness.</p>

<p>“Walm?”</p>

<p>The brother's question causes him to spurt out bubbling, sticky blood. He spoke, though terribly slurred by the air leaking from his ripped throat.</p>

<p>“He-is-what-why?”</p>

<p>Walm, not quite understanding what was happening, questioned. Haze, teeth clicking, repeated his apology, even though he knew it would never be forgiven.</p>

<p>“Walm, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, really.”</p>

<p>I trusted you."</p>

<p>A chill ran down Hayes' spine as he looked into his brother's eyes. Just as the war had changed Hayes, it must have changed Walm as well. His golden eyes, which had never existed in his memory, were dark and murky.</p>

<p>“Betrayed, huh?”</p>

<p>That one word rightly refers to the current situation. The result of plotting against his brother, his immediate family, was the devastation below.</p>

<p>"I love you. Walm ...... sleep."</p>

<p>Hayes quietly thrusts his sword in. Maybe he didn't have the strength to fight back, or maybe he didn't even want to in the first place. His mouth spits out an unbelievable amount of blood, and he stops breathing. I have seen countless dead bodies. Even so, he is not accustomed to seeing the corpses of his own brothers, and he is tormented by an unbearable emotional load.</p>

<p>Now all of his blood brothers are dead. One he couldn't protect, one he killed. His stomach cramps, and he can't hold back the nausea that rises in him, so he avoids the bodies and spreads the stomach acid on them. Hayes sits up from the hip on the ground soaked with fresh blood. His legs, trembling like a fawn, could not catch the ground. His vision was shifting from side to side. Howard, who couldn't bear to look at him, rushed over to him.</p>

<p>"Hayes, I know this is hard for you, but let's get out of here. It's such a commotion. The Highserk patrol will be here soon."</p>

<p>"No, you don't have to support me. I'll stand."</p>

<p>I'm not going to let you play the victim here. My brother was in no way at fault. Hayes stood up and looked down at his brother, who was growing cold. This is real. There is no sign of the face that laughed at their reunion.</p>

<p>"I'm bringing back evidence. Stay away. Hayes."</p>

<p>A friend of mine with a neck tub and an axe approaches at a trot. He is ready to vomit. It was obvious what was about to take place. Hayes was about to leave without replying to Lefty when he noticed that something had spilled out of his brother's hand. It was an ill-advised Demon Mask, which had been reported earlier. What was his brother thinking as he stood on the battlefield wearing this strange mask?</p>

<p>“Demon Mask?”</p>

<p>It may be hideous, but it must be a relic. As Hayes is about to pick it up, the unmovable mask begins to vibrate, and a screeching sound shakes the abandoned village. The mask breaks in half in front of Hayes, who covers his ears. Flesh overflowing from the rupture stretched out in countless directions. The entrapped soldier was sewn to the ground and with a scream, his body was crushed as if he were being devoured. Hayes, who jumped back as quickly as he could, was stunned by the scene before him.</p>

<p>"Damn it, three people swallowed!</p>

<p>“Get out of the way, don't get too close.”</p>

<p>"That thing is not in the information. What's going on!</p>

<p>The blood spurted out and overflowed without stopping, and a sea of red spread out. The flesh, expanding and contracting repeatedly, gathers in one place like a whirlpool. It was the center where Walm had been. Blood splashes down, and the earth is dyed vermilion. What emerged from within was not the remains of his brother. His head was as blue as the deep sea, his eyes were golden, reminiscent of reptiles, and he was two heads taller than Hayes. Wearing the demonic fire that ravages the earth is a female demon.</p>

<p>The body of the female demon is an abominable shadow.</p>

<p>How much time has passed since her body was destroyed by the abominable Onmyoji and Shura-like warriors? How long had it been since his body was destroyed by the abominable Onmyoji and the Shura-like samurai? Even after they were drained into the human world in a great fire, those who had attached themselves to them were unable to offer offerings, and they all died in the battle. The number of those who were allowed to wear it by the ogres, who were so picky about their preferences, could be counted on one hand.</p>

<p>Sometimes covered in dust or buried in the earth, the Demon Masks walked around in human hands. After two devastating wars of the human species, we arrived in a land of other worlds, a land worthy of being called the crucible of chaos. During the Unification War, I had enjoyed myself to the fullest. But it was still not enough. Mene waits and waits, and finally finds a man worthy of his name. The man from his homeland continued to live up to Mene's expectations, offering his blood and flesh. Unlike those who can do nothing but kill, he continues to fight despite his conflicts and anguish, which is quite touching.</p>

<p>Such a man is about to die on the earth because of the wiles of his relatives. Will there ever be another strong man who can match him in both physical and mental strength? Above all, demons are very picky about their preferences. Even though he was a laissez-faire person, he was willing to cooperate if the corpse would be buried for a century or two and then given to someone he didn't like.</p>

<p>The face trembled at the thought of being rounded. I have helped, whether on the tombstone of a fortress or in the bowels of a hideous serpent. But this one owed me a favor that crossed the line. Until the demon is fully manifested in the world, a man must make offerings. And what is more adorable than brothers killing each other out of love and hate?</p>

<p>The offerings were insufficient, but it would be possible for a time if the man's body, which had taken in the eyes of his fellow man, was used as a substitute. The mask decided to consume the stacked sacrifices. The mask, trembling as if in climax, cracked in half, and a sea of blood overflowed. The surrounding air heats up and the swollen flesh takes in the man.</p>

<p>The demon, using the man as a vessel, is born and falls into the world. The ashlar child, whose body and even gender can change, is a female this time. The great demon of the burning of the country, which has reduced people, towns, and even the country to ashes, comes into the world. Through the five senses, I tremble with delight at the world that flows into my body. The air he inhaled into his lungs was exhaled in the form of a voice, and he roared at his foolish adversary.</p>

<p>Episode 41</p>

<p>“It's a mind-numbingly grimy slope.”</p>

<p>The brown forest soil was damp, as if it had been sucking living blood. It is not surprising that such thoughts would come to mind if one were on the Orserica Slope, where the blood has not dried since the clash over the Celta Peninsula took place. Paramust, the first centurion of the Craist Royal Army, was the commander in charge of a corps composed of Felius militia. Considering the current situation in which the majority of officers are from the Kingdom of Craist, it is a rare case that a man from the Ferius family is appointed to the rank of commander of five centurions.</p>

<p>Palamst's military career is long, and he is now one of the few commanders who experienced the decisive battle of Eidenberg. In the midst of a general army collapse, Ferius lost many of his generals. His classmates and superiors were no exception, and most of them were either killed or taken prisoner. Because of this experience, he was more sensitive than most to the threat of the Highserk Imperial Army approaching from the mainland.</p>

<p>"This is a place of great adversity, where even the Great Outbreak has been received. Breaking through will not be easy. But there is no more time to spare. We cannot allow any further stagnation in an outpost that is not even a tributary castle."</p>

<p>Palamsto cuts off his words once and shares his sense of urgency with the hundred chiefs who are lined up. The capture of Celta Rokkou was an urgent task for the Craist Royal Army, but by the time they had grasped the defensive position of the cut-through, one of their units had been depleted.</p>

<p>"As you know, the front is an earthwork using the ridge, and the right side is a steep slope that is almost a cliff. Along the left side of the ridge, the difference in elevation is small, but there is a cut bank that has been carved out of the edge of the ridge."</p>

<p>No one objected to the first centurion. This was confirmed by each troop as they made sacrifices.</p>

<p>"It's not all bad. There is also good news. The Duchy of Myard's army defending this hill of Orserica is mainly made up of recruits. It's better than other points of attack. I would even say that we are blessed."</p>

<p>This was generally true, although it was intended to inspire the officers to make a reluctant face as bitter experiences were evoked. In the other six mouths, several centurions have disappeared from the books altogether. Considering this, casualties in the Orserica area were modest.</p>

<p>"The Lord Commander of the Knights has given us encouragement that he expects us to be on the offensive in Orzerica. We must respond to this. Therefore, we will launch a major offensive from today. We would like to hear your honest opinions."</p>

<p>"On the right is a cliff, but if the soldiers are light and have the wind attribute, they should be able to climb the cliff on the left.</p>

<p>The centurion, the oldest in the corps except for Palamst, takes the initiative in making the suggestion. This was a consideration so that the others would not falter.</p>

<p>"It's a good idea, but we still have a long way to go. We can't let our precious magic bearers rush in and wear them out. Let them concentrate on being attractors."</p>

<p>"After a few days of attack, we've finished setting up a detour and a hill in front of the earthworks. You can leave the covering of the advance to us."</p>

<p>"The force push and the wounded will be incomparable to what we have seen so far. We don't have enough healing magicians, but we will make sure that we are fully prepared with burning trowels, application cloths, etc."</p>

<p>The conversation is lively and the schedule is lubricated. When the agenda was exhausted, Palamst began to summarize.</p>

<p>"The top priorities right now are the mage and the commander. Be especially careful of that middle-aged woman. She can crush armor and gut flesh with her bare hands."</p>

<p>The female commander, who was around mature age, was the biggest threat to the cut-through. Her physical strength far exceeding that of a normal person and her “skill” in strengthening her body were enough to make the small army cower. In addition, even in a melee situation, her clear voice can strike fear into the hearts of the enemy and reassurance into the hearts of her allies. It was one of the factors that made the earthworks so well defended by the troops, the majority of whom were new recruits.</p>

<p>"There are a few other officers who move well. Hit them in numbers and kill them for sure. Any other opinions?　...... We will now launch an attack on the Orsellica cut-through."</p>

<p>After a careful scrubbing, Palamst ordered the attack on the cut-through. After saluting, the centurions left for the columns they were leading. A moment after the brief military meeting, a total of 600 soldiers were advancing up the slope of Orserica. The army, advancing up the hill, which is dark even in the daytime, detaches itself from the rest of the army. They solemnly deviate from the traffic path and scramble across the uneven terrain toward the cut-off bank.</p>

<p>The eyes of the assembled soldiers were bloodshot, and their repeated breathing was evidence of a quelling of their rising hearts. The right amount of tension produces the right amount of focus. Not a bad situation. The soldiers under Palamusto's command have been baptized in blood by the cutting away of the demon territory, and their experience has been transformed into confidence. In addition to the plundering along the way, they are promised fertile lands after the fall of Celta. It is not a desolate demon territory, but farmland.</p>

<p>“We must drop it, no matter what.”</p>

<p>So far, the Ferius refugees have been given food and shelter by the Kingdom of Craist, although it is far from sufficient, and a minimum viable environment has been created. It is an open secret that this is a calculated relief that also serves to increase military strength and cultivate farmland, and even the children know this. That is why, weighing the gains and losses, I intend to fulfill my obligation, however calculating it may be. Many of the people gathered here would agree.</p>

<p>Palamusto breathes in the air with his lungs full. Many dead will be among the old Fellians before the wasteland bears fruit. It is a choice between sitting on it or taking the land and food from the neighboring countries. I have already made up my mind.</p>

<p>“All hands, let's go!”</p>

<p>The order of the paramour was repeated by the centurion and propagated throughout the battlefield. The drummers beat their drum beater, shaking the atmosphere and pushing back the oncoming mundane soldiers. As in previous battles, arrows and stones rained down on the soldiers who were advancing toward the earthworks, and attack magic scattered their flesh and blood.</p>

<p>“Aaaaahhhh!”</p>

<p>“What the hell, where did that come from?”</p>

<p>The militia was not left out of the fray. They had crushed the rough terrain and built a fortified hill, a siege position, out of the timber and earth left over from the quarry. The thick soil could catch even a direct hit from attack magic, and the earth and sand piled up to the height of the cut-through allowed for direct fire on the earthworks.</p>

<p>"Attack from the hillside, don't leave only the nadir!　Cut off the followers from the detour!"</p>

<p>A small, experienced enemy non-commissioned officer was holding the reins of the floating soldiers. He was an officer of the Highserk Imperial Guard, although he was mixed in with the Myard soldiers. The archers who had received their orders shot arrows at the soldiers who were leaning out from their finishing positions and placing shields, and were worn out by the time they reached the earthworks.</p>

<p>“You Highserk who are used to fighting all the time,...... but that level of projectiles won't be enough to stop them.”</p>

<p>Many of them reached the earthworks and climbed up the uneven slope, shields in hand.</p>

<p>"Mage soldiers, hold off on your attacks, you'll wind up your allies. The rest is a simple force push!　Don't let the new soldiers push you around."</p>

<p>There was a resounding crash, as if pebbles had been scraped together with a sieve. It was the sound of the two sides clashing over the placement of their spearheads. Sharp spears slipped through, scraping armor and chipping away at flesh. The end of one Myard soldier who fell from his horse after being pierced through the ankle was horrific.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, oh, oh!”</p>

<p>The impact of the fall caused the new soldier to let out a moan. To his enemy, Palamusto, it was an awfully long time. He should have swung his sword or begged for his life. The deadly Craist militiamen were quick to react.</p>

<p>"No, no, no, no, no, no!</p>

<p>He was stabbed to death at random, and soon lost his original shape. Palamst didn't keep his eyes peeled for long, as is often the case. Their direct contest gradually closed the distance, and in some cases, it soured into a swordfight.</p>

<p>“Damn, you're persistent!”</p>

<p>The battle line was partially distorted, but it was alive and well. In the inferior parts of the battle, the corpses of Craist's soldiers are piled up so high that there is no place to step. It is understandable that commanders with skills that act on the body, “rigidity” and “vigor”, are on the rampage. Even in military discussions, priority was given to the least exhausted units to hold them down. But why is it that the whole army has not collapsed at all? Palamusto, who was carefully observing the earthworks, did not miss the sharp thrusts mixed in with the spears of the miscellaneous soldiers.</p>

<p>"That man again. Like the Highserk troops at Cape Gara, they're a pain in the ass from one end to the other."</p>

<p>Axe spears shook in all directions through the gaps between the slow spears. Each time, fresh blood dances in the void. It reminds me of Eidenberg, even if I don't like it. Lightly armed infantry crossing the hill with their horse guards, the blue flames that billow up, the cavalry unit that became one with man and horse - the memory rings alarm bells.</p>

<p>"...... enemy is not the Highserk of those days. It's a slice, an end that remains, after all. What are you thinking?"</p>

<p>The womanly reminder of the old battlefield, the abomination of the enemy, sets my teeth on edge. Somehow Palamst couldn't wipe away the old memories. Before he could try to find the cause, his years of experience on the battlefield as a commander sniffed out an anomaly in the earthworks. A battle cry echoed from the cut bank to the left. The lightly armed troops that had separated had moved to attack the flanks. The small force could not be decisive. Even so, some personnel were allocated to deal with the new attackers. The blood vessels in my brain were flowing like a torrent, and my thoughts were spinning rapidly.</p>

<p>"Aim between the enemy left flank and the center. Palamst Centurions, all hands, charge!"</p>

<p>Finding a breakthrough as the commander, Palamusto jumped down from the hill and ordered the troops directly below him that were waiting in reserve. It was the reserve force that had been held back as the decisive force. They were ready to charge in at any moment. The troops immediately below them told their friends, who had been exhausted from the battle with the enemy, "Make way!</p>

<p>“Make way, we are breaking through at once!”</p>

<p>“Don't let the Palamusto centurion stand in front of us, go on!”</p>

<p>Move it, move it, move it! We'll be trampled!</p>

<p>The soldiers who had been herded onto the mound ahead of the others dodged at a single glance. Keeping their arrowheads in place, the centurions ran up the slope and cut down the recruits by sheer numbers. The enemy, who had secured part of the horse treads, was quick to respond. Already unable to block the breakthrough, they systematically pulled back from the flat to an earthen circle.</p>

<p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p>

<p>"The earthwork has been breached. Retreat to the curved circle!!!!"</p>

<p>The cut-through was successfully secured. Should we prepare the disorganized troops and then challenge the circle in stages? Paramusto hesitates, but the memory of the dukedom, which he should have shaken off, passes through his mind. It's abominable. It was all the fault of those Highserk soldiers. He must let go of his weakness.</p>

<p>Palamusto consciously switches his thoughts. With the exception of a few small positions, he would be able to aim directly at the tributary castle once he had passed through the bazaar. Then the Palamst militia would be ordered to regroup in the rear, having earned the necessary achievements. The enemy had crumbled. Now is the perfect time to pursue and expand the war effort.</p>

<p>"The enemy has collapsed, push them all the way to the ring!</p>

<p>Even if we can't get them to the ring, we can still take out a good number of their men. The soldiers responded to Palamusto's call, and one after another, they crossed the inner law. The enemy's female commander joined the lord and ordered a retreat at the rear of the line. The mace pushed back the sword, and the pioneer who touched the outstretched fist popped like a ripe fruit. But the battle had been decided.</p>

<p>Myard's soldiers, who had failed to escape, were skewered from all sides by spears, and another was hit in the back by an arrow and slumped to the ground. Following in their footsteps, a longsword is swung at a new soldier who stumbles. The side that caused the total collapse was determined, as it should have been.</p>

<p>“It's an axe spear, .......”</p>

<p>As if slicing through the atmosphere, the magical blade parted the half of Craist's soldiers in tears. Drawing a semicircle of blood trails, the Highserk soldier holding the axe spear stood in the line of fire, rather than fleeing.</p>

<p>“Get out of the way!”</p>

<p>The two following militiamen leap at them without fear. The two militiamen leap at them without fear, striking down from above their heads and thrusting at their lower abdomen. It was a brilliant coordination, despite the fact that they were soldiers. Paramusto was sure that the tip of the spear had caught the head, but the spear slipped through as if it were grasping mist.</p>

<p>The Highserk soldier, half drawn and half sliding, slammed the thrust into the ground with the axe-head, and then reared the axe-spear along with the hilt. The throat cracked open and the spearman sank in a spray of blood.</p>

<p>“Side!!!!”</p>

<p>When the remaining militiamen readied themselves, the Highserk soldier was stooping down and swinging his axe-spear. Reacting to Palamst's call, he interrupted the spear, but the massive axe head chopped off the head by the hilt. The head rolled around on the ground in time with the crumbling torso.</p>

<p>“Get back, quick!!!!”</p>

<p>Crawling unsteadily, the new soldier runs away without looking aside. The noisy corner of the battlefield maintains a strange stillness. Contrary to the spear technique demonstrated, the man's physique and equipment were commonplace, as if he could be found anywhere. The difference between the two made the strangeness stand out, whether it was intentional or not.</p>

<p>He was being pushed. The Highserk army in his memory has become bloated, and he is showing the illusion of it. In fact, after showing so much work, the new recruits they saved and even the commanders who were mixed in with the Tono rushed into the curved circle without even looking aside. They are just such good pawns, and even if they are allied forces, this is what they are after all. The brave and good die first. It was the same in Aidenberg.</p>

<p>“Ten chiefs, crush them!”</p>

<p>Palamst ordered in a flat voice. Judging them to be a threat, Palamst sent the biggest compliment he could muster. A wall of spears was created as the ten chiefs shouted.</p>

<p>"I do not say in vain. You have saved some recruits."</p>

<p>The first centurion let slip, so that his men could not hear him. The man was leisurely fishing in his waist pouch while the line of spears was closing in. He was giving up - somewhat disappointed. Fatty sweat broke out all over Palamusto's body as he lost interest and tried to see the end of the story. The man who had been mixed in with the miscreants wore a magical membrane that shook the atmosphere, and Demon Masks. Ah, damn you, I did not abandon the enemy commander or the recruits. They had fled, from this imperial knight.</p>

<p>“Kill me, quick!”</p>

<p>It was his natural calm and commanding prudence that had allowed him to survive the Adenbergs. Where did I go wrong? Why didn't I remember? How could I not remember the face of the man who had burned the mighty Kingsguard and the brilliant Winston on that hill?</p>

<p>"First centurion, what's-- ah!</p>

<p>The soldiers, who were startled by their superior's exclamation, understood belatedly. The color in their vision was a clear blue like the sky. But there was nothing more they could do. The spears that stretched out were helplessly far away, even though there were only a few of them left. The group of ten who had rushed in were engulfed and burned by the hot wind.</p>

<p>"Oh, Demon Fire! Get back!"</p>

<p>“Damn, damn it, I'm stuck!”</p>

<p>I had plenty of opportunities to use it in the past battles. Why now - or perhaps because now? Palamusto bites his lip in regret. He was waiting for the new recruits as live bait. The dense army was about to cross the mound.</p>

<p>“You, you, you, you are being tricked, ah, ah, ah, ah--”</p>

<p>The “lure of the underworld,” a light that should never be lured on the battlefield. Blue flames swirled across the plain separated by earthen mounds, engulfing the people. The gate to the underworld opened its jaws with the call of screams. Demon Fire" danced across the land of Orsellica, and the illuminated demons laughed and snickered.</p>

<p>Episode 39</p>

<p>"Seh-no!</p>

<p>With a bold call, a log reminiscent of a castle-breaking hammer strikes the earth. It was a cylindrical piece of wood with four handles, a tool used for striking the ground. The men, their bodies steaming from hard labor and dripping with sweat, had removed all but the lower half of their clothes, not to mention their protective gear. The construction work was about to be completed by these dirt-covered soldiers. Walm stepped on the trapezoid-shaped mound that had been formed after the cobblestones had been removed.</p>

<p>“For a hastily built structure, it's surprisingly strong.”</p>

<p>He admires their dedication to the dependable feel of their shoes' soles. The rolling pressure that drew air and water out of the ground turned the pile of leftover soil into a barrier.</p>

<p>"It's better than the temporary walls at Dandurg. Everything was so steep over there, but the cut-throughs over here are supposed to be backfilled."</p>

<p>Deborah replies, staring off into the distance. The half-dozen men of the company of drill soldiers are hurriedly carrying welcoming supplies to the horse treads at the top of the earthworks. The slope of Orserica, the corner that in peacetime supports the traffic of the Celta peninsula as the Six Mouths of Zelebes, was once again blocked off as an inhospitable ridge.</p>

<p>“The only difference is the hue.”</p>

<p>The excavation, the cut, has been filled in to restore the appearance it had before the road opened. The only difference is the bald mountain that interrupts the green carpet that covers the bank.</p>

<p>"The ridge section is still grassed over to prevent the slope from collapsing. If there's a bald spot, it's going to be noticeable."</p>

<p>Yogim patted his forehead, which continued to recede lovingly. The god who doesn't touch it is cursed. Walm gently removed his gaze and turned to the recruits gathered at the edge of the sky. They had finished their reconstructions and had removed the dirt and grime, and were wearing the equipment they had been shedding.</p>

<p>“From a distance,” he said, “they're a fully armed army themselves.”</p>

<p>Walm, who had been through many deadly encounters, was aware of their fragility. They were all dressed up on the outside, but their essentials were all over the place. One recruit repeatedly took shallow breaths to suppress the nausea rising in him. Another was shaking his spear as if frozen, his face scrunched up. Tension spreads. The new recruits who had completed their work were exhausted, albeit to varying degrees. The ones who were exhausted from the work of the construction were healthier than the ones who were not.</p>

<p>“......I wonder if I finished the work too early.”</p>

<p>“Rudely, your visitors didn't let me know what time it was.”</p>

<p>Deborah lurks in her normal, well-pitched voice, and Yogim answers in a whisper, too. Walm agreed with the couple's secret. If there were skilled underlings, they would be walking around making fun of the soldiers to see how they were doing, but with the current Duchy of Myard's army, a company of trained soldiers, there was no hope for that. However, it is not to be wished for in the current Duchy of Meyerdorf's army, especially in a company of trained soldiers. Memories of the past pass through her mind. In the forest where she first killed a man, she was covered in fresh blood and vomit. I couldn't let it be just because I was inexperienced. I had to take care of him a little bit.</p>

<p>“I'm going away for a minute.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I'll take care of it.”</p>

<p>With the instructor's permission, Walm began to roam the earthworks. It was not because Deborah and Yogim were bored that they were repeatedly wasting time. It is because they know from experience that unnecessary tension leads to low morale and fatigue. That is why the old soldiers laugh aloud at stories that are not very interesting, while only their eyes glaze over.</p>

<p>Walm, who wanders around, sets his sights on one of the new recruits, who looks as if he is praying for something. His eyes are tightly shut, as if he is praying for something. He is unaware of Walm's approach.</p>

<p>“I'm getting sleepy in this kind of light coming through the trees.”</p>

<p>“Heh, ah?”</p>

<p>The soldier, whose consciousness had flown to the distant world, was slow to react.</p>

<p>“Gaston, it's the Chief Protector.”</p>

<p>The soldier next to him, who couldn't help but notice, announced the arrival of the imperial knight. The soldier called Gaston blinks blindly, as if he were a corporate warrior who had overslept. He turned around in a panic, but in the wrong direction. In his dismay, Walm taps him on the shoulder and leads him to face him.</p>

<p>“Hey, hey, hey, you're not asleep, are you?”</p>

<p>"No, sir.</p>

<p>The new recruit, who was slurred but remembered the courtesies he had learned in his military life, tried to salute, but Walm gently refused.</p>

<p>"Don't salute, make yourself comfortable. Gaston."</p>

<p>“I'm sorry, sir, um, I'm not sleepwalking.”</p>

<p>Gaston said, chest out and upright, as if he had mistakenly thought he was being reprimanded by an imperial knight. The soldiers around him watched on, sympathizing with their comrade's blunder.</p>

<p>"I see. I'm walking around, I'm so sleepy. If I doze off, I'll be beaten by that dreadful instructor. Did you see the kumite in the drill hall?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's a great fighter.</p>

<p>Walm interrupted the itching pleasantries.</p>

<p>"Ha, stop it, I'm the one who swelled up all over. I was scolded by the healer for that. I'll never do that again."</p>

<p>Gaston's cheeks relaxed as the imperial knight's brow furrowed in disgust. He must have been scolded by Deborah, who wielded the caustic physical language of training. The shared bitter memory of fists created a connection between the knight and the recruit. Small talks, which tended to break off at first, progressed as mutual understanding grew. The cramped conditions of the battlefield can make people talkative as long as they are given a chance.</p>

<p>“That guy over there--”</p>

<p>The smoky knight from another country chatting away was a unique sight. Curiosity can kill a cat. Walm, who had lured in the other recruits without resorting to blue flames, did not miss the one whose gaze met his.</p>

<p>“That's Evrak.”</p>

<p>Gaston, who had been talking to him, took the initiative and mentioned the name of his companion. Walm initially thought he was unreliable, but perhaps he was more to the point than he thought.</p>

<p>“What, you're from the same area?”</p>

<p>“Yes, most of them are from the same region.”</p>

<p>It was a good idea to have a group of people from the same hometown, if only for the sake of solidarity. The only problem was that if the unit was destroyed, all the workers in the area would be lost. Walm, keeping his dark thoughts hidden, asked.</p>

<p>"Evrak, huh? What's the matter, you don't look well. Have you been properly supplied with food?"</p>

<p>“We were supplied with flatbread and beans at the branch castle along the way.”</p>

<p>"That hard, jaw-dropping stuff? From the looks of it, you missed out."</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to eat whole-grain bread that has been baked to last for a long time. Even a knife is too sharp. The good ones would soak up the necessary amount of bread beforehand, but the recruit in front of me seemed to have neglected to do so. It was not something that could be eaten on the sidelines of a march.</p>

<p>“I'm ashamed to say that I couldn't chew it as it was, so I put it in my pocket.”</p>

<p>"I'm sure you're right, it's not edible if you don't soak it in hot water. I left some of it behind too."</p>

<p>He pulls a piece of hard-baked bread the size of a clenched fist out of his hip sack. It was a foreign object that could not even be eaten properly without offering all the water in his mouth.</p>

<p>"It's been deflated some. Now you just need to get some saliva in your mouth and chew it patiently. Eat it while you can."</p>

<p>Walm said, and with that, he shredded the bread, handing one half to Evrard and popping the rest into his mouth. It was as hard as ever. The more he chewed with his back teeth, the more water was lost in his mouth. A hint of regret came to his mind, but he could not change his attitude in the face of the soldiers.</p>

<p>“Thank you!!!!”</p>

<p>After uttering his thanks, Evraak followed the example of the imperial knight and munched the bread in one gulp. Even Walm had trouble chewing it. The result of having more than half of the whole in the mouth comes immediately. The repeated chewing, the clay-like consistency and hardness of the bread filled the new recruit with distress.</p>

<p>“I see you like it.”</p>

<p>“Hey, that guy from Evryk, he looks terrible.”</p>

<p>"The chief protector even has a special chin. You're copying me."</p>

<p>“No, no, no, no, no!”</p>

<p>The mud fight between his jaw and the hard-baked bread was an unforgettable experience for him. He would not make the same mistake. The new recruits were making fun of their colleague's ugliness. There was no undue tension left. That is how Walm learned military life. The noisy, troublesome people, the old routine that would never return. The tar-like bitterness numbed his brain.</p>

<p>With a thin smile on his face, the imperial knight left the place. Sometimes he laughed at the soldiers, sometimes he was amused, and sometimes he joked playfully with them. It was a terrible deception. He might listen to their complaints and anxieties, but as a knight, he would never let them know. I wondered if the dynamic squad leader was also harboring such things in his heart. The reason for his refusal to accept promotion flashed through my mind. After exchanging a few comforting words that made me thirsty, Walm rounded the mound and returned to Deborah.</p>

<p>“Thanks for all your hard work.”</p>

<p>“It was a nice way to pass the time.”</p>

<p>Walm, who had been speaking lightly and blithely, corrected his posture when he saw the seriousness in the couple's eyes.</p>

<p>“Mr. Walm, I need you to do me a favor ...... and take care of my soldiers.”</p>

<p>Giddy at Yogim's request, Walm shook his head.</p>

<p>"You've got to be kidding me. I'm supposed to be used for blocking firepower."</p>

<p>"I'm not saying you have to command the troops. I'm not asking you to lead the troops, just to look out for them. I really wanted to have Moyes do it, but he's overwhelmed."</p>

<p>"Your son has been through the battle of Dandurg.</p>

<p>"That's because I'm a parent. I've been a bit lenient with my children, haven't I? You know, even on the same battlefield, people and demons are different, you know.</p>

<p>Walm understood what he was saying. Many people are very reluctant to kill people, even if they can kill demons with a humming sound. Even if it leads to their own death. Even adventurers who are accustomed to roughing it are like that. They are different from warlords who specialize in killing people.</p>

<p>“I can't refuse ...... a beautiful woman's request.”</p>

<p>"Ha, you say. I'm asking you. Show them the battlefield."</p>

<p>On the surface, Walm readily agreed, and left the clearing and took up a position in a corner of the clearing. He took out a soldier's cigarette from his pocket and lit a blue flame. The purple smoke, carried away by the mountain wind, melts away in the crowd.</p>

<p>“You bother me a little, let me skip work at least a little bit.”</p>

<p>He sighs a sigh mixed with white smoke at the Demon Mask, which is blaming him for his laziness. He sighs in a cloud of white smoke at the face of the ogre, which is blaming him for his laziness. Sliding his gaze, he also sees the recruits with whom he exchanged a few words.</p>

<p>“Haha, you look like you're having fun ...... Well, did I make you do that?”</p>

<p>Pure innocence, they knew nothing of the colors of war yet. The feeling of their guts stirring, the decimation of enemy soldiers, their dying comrades-in-arms. The truth is that we had to teach them about the horrific and fearless war rather than convenient words. As predecessors who were good at killing people.</p>

<p>In a way, the Highserk empire was kind, if only in the aspect of not showing the illusion of hope. I inhaled a lung full of purple smoke and blew it out in front of me. It was as if there was a fog hanging over them. In a world separated by white smoke, Walm revealed his true feelings.</p>

<p>“I shouldn't have asked their names.”</p>

<p>Frowning at the bitter taste that clung to his tongue and the unbearable aftertaste, the imperial knight stopped trying to escape reality and returned to the line of battle.</p>

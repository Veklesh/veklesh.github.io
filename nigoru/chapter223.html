<p>Episode 68</p>

<p>The Liberitoa Trade Federation, the vipers that lurk in the dark corners of the Federation, are talking. The battle for the Celta Peninsula did not go as the Congress had hoped. Indeed, the territory of the Duchy of Myard was ravaged by war, and the elite forces deployed by Highserk were also worn out. Craist, who had gained a disproportionate amount of territory, also lost one of his symbols, one of his three heroes, and the Knight Commander Gran. On that point alone, they would have been satisfied.</p>

<p>But it was not the best they could have hoped for. The Commercial Federation provided support to the Kingdom of Craist, which had little strength, with the help of a water fleet and supplies. Compared to such excessive costs, the war results were quite modest. Although their forces were worn out, both sides were frightened of a decisive battle, and no decisive battle took place. The main field forces were untangled on the battlefield and remained in their original form. To top it all off, the Knights of Reharzen had fled to the country, having failed in their objective.</p>

<p>Many of those who were watching the battle from the other side of the river went blank. Some of them were even physically and abstractly depressed. However, as admirable federalists by their own admission and others', they quickly recovered. It is easy to rest for a reason. Therefore, laziness must be abhorred. If we indulge in the stagnation of maintaining the status quo, the only thing that awaits us is decline. This was an unchanging fact in both love affairs and political disputes.</p>

<p>The next move was about to be made in the capital city of the Commonwealth of Commerce, the largest city in the northern countries, a cavernous pit where vipers coiled themselves around the ninth floor.</p>

<p>“So, who is in overall command?”</p>

<p>Hugo, the Foreign Minister of the Liberitoa Trade Federation, asked his assistant, Enoch.</p>

<p>“I am Warwen Logmeier, who was the commander of the Highserk area forces for many years.”</p>

<p>Hugo's mouth quirks up in response to his aide, who answers without hesitation. It was a thin smile that could have been either a smile or a burn cramp.</p>

<p>“I guess it depends on how you put it.”</p>

<p>Enoch expressed concern at the foreign minister's tone, which was tinged with a shadow of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>“You think he's in the habit of retreating?”</p>

<p>"Well, yes. I wouldn't go so far as to call it a habit of retreating, but it must be heavy on the buttocks. You have not operated aggressively against the empire so far, have you? It is hard to accept his selection, but there is no substitute."</p>

<p>Hugo is not pleased with the commander's self-proclaimed moderate backing. The foreign minister has always appealed to the Reich to take precautionary measures. It would be unacceptable from a security perspective to leave a beast that does not know when it has enough under its feet.</p>

<p>If there is a pebble that trips over a roadside, remove it, and if there is a rotten tree, cut it down. That is all. Hugo is considered a hardliner for simply asking for what is natural for a human being. What a tragedy. It was extremely regrettable.</p>

<p>“Regardless of the internal situation, the posing of a united front is--”</p>

<p>"I understand. I know, but we can always swallow minor differences of opinion in times of crisis, can't we?"</p>

<p>Disagreements. The moderates - if I may speak for the Woyen strategy - are to use tactics and force to tighten the siege. If that provokes an outburst, lure them into key areas and chip away at them. There is a point. But they will not raise their hands to that degree. They accumulate power, and they always try to overcome the barriers of the state. Kanoa and Felius, both of whom perished, were bad examples of this.</p>

<p>Therefore, Hugo aims for a decisive surrender. They will not understand reason unless they are overpowered by force. The Highserk Empire is a nation that has been trained by a combination of such men.</p>

<p>"The opponent is the Imperial Army, which has been weakened repeatedly, but a wounded beast is a fearsome thing. This is no time to be obsessed with factions and masks."</p>

<p>Even the Commercial Federation, which has the geographical strength befitting an ally of the northern countries, cannot escape the logic of its organization. The larger the body, the more difficult it becomes to unify the will. The larger the body, the more difficult it is to unify the will of the people, and it is only when the defense of the mainland shakes the country that the true value of the organization can be demonstrated. However, the moderates were unusually enthusiastic. It would be impolite not to take their hands gently and dance with them.</p>

<p>"Even the Myard navy, which had been blockaded around the Celta Peninsula, has turned into a formidable onslaught.</p>

<p>Even Hugo could not believe his ears when he received a report from the naval liaison that was mixed with screams.</p>

<p>"I never thought that the Myards, who are obsessed with the peninsula and abhor losses, would be so intent on a fleet decisive battle. And they had the audacity to send their warships into the ice. It's a great change, and it's absolutely abhorrent."</p>

<p>The surface fleet is a relic of the Kanoan era. Today, Myard does not have the ability to replenish its fleet that it once boasted. It was therefore remarkably unfettered, but at the last minute it reversed its operations. Rita Myard, who had been just a girl easy to ambush in the days of the Quadripartite Alliance, had survived the war and transformed herself into a monarch typical of the northern states.</p>

<p>"They have been influenced by the Highserk empire, but in a good way. That is why it is folly to give them time and grace. Their madness is easily contagious."</p>

<p>"It's as bad in nature as an epidemic. The navy must be feeling very small."</p>

<p>The navy's defeat in the fleet battle that resulted from the Myard navy as a virtual enemy was a one-to-two ratio. The loss of ships at a ratio of one to two was, in anyone's eyes, a blunder.</p>

<p>In addition, there was a difference after the conclusion of the battle on the water. Compared to Liberitoa's navy, which sailed from a remote location, Myard's navy was in its home turf, making it easier to tow damaged vessels. Some of their warships even failed to sink themselves and were captured. Even young children who had finished playing would still be diligent in cleaning up the mess.</p>

<p>“They used to have a lot of self-esteem and attitude, but now I hear they are as quiet as dwarfs.”</p>

<p>“I think that's good medicine for them.”</p>

<p>Too much of a good medicine is a poison. After you've given them a good dose, loosen the leash and show them the way out.</p>

<p>You're trying to ingratiate yourself with them, so they'll take advantage of you.</p>

<p>"Enoch, you're not very good with words. It would be natural for you to reach out to your fellow man in a crisis."</p>

<p>Hugo's burn face twitches and he declares with a benevolent smile. Nothing is politics but kicking down. It is also essential to reach out to those who are weak.</p>

<p>“Well, it's a little early for the hapless Craist to collapse, but the arrangements are made.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it's about time.”</p>

<p>Hugo, who had abandoned his wan smile, declared as if to himself.</p>

<p>"Launch the invasion against the Highserk Empire. ...... This time, we will screw them over. Completely."</p>

<p>And so the Liberitian Commercial Federation's invasion of Highserk was launched.</p>

<p>◆</p>

<p>Not all were amenable to the struggle between nations. Orban, a longtime fisherman on Lake Celta, was one such man with little social sense. Although he is classified as a former Felician, his nationality is merely a matter of convenience, as he fished near the shores of the lake in the Kingdom of Felius and the Duchy of Myard. They have little dependence on the state and little sense of belonging. They were forced to leave their beds after the expansion of the demon territory due to the Great Outbreak, and they have only designated the Duchy of Myard as their country while they are on land.</p>

<p>Celta fishermen are in a constant relationship of eat and be eaten with the carnivorous fish and demons of the giant lakes. Among the daredevil fishermen, Aubin is the odd one out, an eccentric and stubborn old man who has no successor to nurture.</p>

<p>He lives and dies with the lake and his boat. It is a simple and straightforward way of life. He has never been lonely, but the increase in the number of fishermen due to the shortage of food has upset his life. The old man, who had always been a hunter of prey, was targeted. The young men who wanted to become his apprentices.</p>

<p>Oban literally kicked out the aspiring apprentices who clung to him. He knew from experience that the weak youngsters with swollen buttocks would turn tail and run away. So far, it was a common story.</p>

<p>If there was any miscalculation on the part of the old man who accepted even the Great Outbreak, it was that they and their families were forced to leave their land and their homeland. The drowning man will cling to anything. This, too, Oban knew from experience to the point of disgust. Day after day, the old man and the young men continued to fight, and a month passed.</p>

<p>It was a clear day when they could see all the way to the bottom of the water. The old man took them on his boat. It was not because he was overcome by the enthusiasm of the sprouts who asked him day after day, but it was just a whim. Even the most heinous of people, even sinners, do unexpectedly small good deeds in their lives. It just happened to coincide with his mood.</p>

<p>Oban does not cut corners in his work. The young men on the boat are also literally putting their lives and livelihoods on the line. Fists and curses flying at the same time were a daily occurrence, but they gradually diminished in number. Now, two years later, the ship was moving like a living organism. Whether he wanted to or not, the old fisherman had become the captain of a small boat with a capacity of three people. His peers, who knew the story, ridiculed the old man who loved solitude and missed it.</p>

<p>The fishing boats operated by Oban had moved away from the competitive shoals and lakeshores, and their new fishing grounds were in the offshore waters. Naturally, the dangers of a short boat that can fly away from the shore are inherent. Still, the relationship with Lake Celta is one of eat-and-be-eaten. Oban didn't feel bad if he was going to die and return to the water. The kids on board would not like it.</p>

<p>The surface of the water is calmer than on land. Although there may be clashes over fishing grounds, the killing is not as gruesome as it is on land. Most of the time, it's just threats and cursing. Even if a slight incompatibility or an unfortunate misunderstanding leads to a brawl, only a few people are killed or injured. It is trivial compared to the people of the land, who kill and are killed by their own people in villages and countries, and fight each other for land.</p>

<p>“A little more, right, right ...... okay, slow down.”</p>

<p>With the slight difference in the shouts and the rhythm of the boatman's waving hands, the rowers put the blades of their oars to the water and changed direction. The three-horse short boat slowly slows down. Contrary to the stillness of the boat, the apprentices' lungs are hungry for oxygen, and they breathe in and out.</p>

<p>The small sails, one of the driving forces, are folded, and the mast stands like a dead tree that has lost its leaves. Aubin slips past the mast that sits in the center of the hull and the rowers, and moves swiftly toward the stern. He extended his grappling hook, which he carried beside him, and caught a shadow floating on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The boatman pulls the object toward the hull of the boat, not caring about the unstable foothold. The hook, which has become as familiar to him as a limb, will not let the object escape once it is in its grasp.</p>

<p>“Pull it up.”</p>

<p>It was the least he could say, but it was enough to get the old man's intention across to the young men. Leaving their posts, they grabbed the drifting object that was nestled against the short boat.</p>

<p>“Ugh, it's heavier than it looks.”</p>

<p>“What's inside, boatman?”</p>

<p>The young men's eyes lit up as they paddled and panted.</p>

<p>"I don't know. But it's liquid."</p>

<p>Normally, under Oban's direction, they would throw in their nets and prepare to grapple with the attacking demons. But this day's prey was a little different. It had been three days since the fleet battle that violently raged through the water. After a great deal of destruction and sacrifice, it brought blessings to both man and beast.</p>

<p>Rescuers and drowned bodies that were not retrieved were turned into food for the demons, and discarded lumber and supplies drifted on the surface of the lake. Even fisherman-like creatures, who normally frolic in the shallows, head offshore to catch the drifting debris. The wreckage of naval vessels and soldiers' equipment can be bought by the government, and the contents of barrels and crates are sometimes valuable. It was a treasure hunt, after all.</p>

<p>“Open it!”</p>

<p>The young men waited and pried open the tops of the crates with hatchets. The straw stuffed as a cushioning material contained moisture and stuck to the top of the box. They found a cluster of liquor bottles at the end of the pry. Some of the bottles were cracked and the contents leaked out, but half of them retained their original shape. The distinctive aroma immediately revealed itself.</p>

<p>"Wow, it's rum from the archipelago countries!</p>

<p>“It's the one that came in via the Flame Dragon Corridor.”</p>

<p>Aubin, who quickly reached out his hand while the young man was excited, declares.</p>

<p>“It's strange, but it must be a blessing from Lake Celta.”</p>

<p>The boatman popped the cork and sipped the lake's bounty. Mixed sweetness and bitterness. The sweet aroma escapes the nose and the spirit slides down the esophagus. His stomach slowly heated up, and Oban exhaled with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Whew--!”</p>

<p>“Nah, that's not fair!”</p>

<p>"You don't mind, boatman?　I'll have a drink too."</p>

<p>Following the old fisherman, the two young men slurp down their bottles of sake. Half of the hold is now filled with recovered goods. An unexpected gift has also been bestowed. The fishing was perfect. As their bodies, chilled by the night winds, regain their senses, a wave shakes on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>“...... take up arms.”</p>

<p>The harmonious atmosphere was blown away with a single shout. He hauled up the hatchets and harpoons lying on the bottom of the boat and sank into a posture.</p>

<p>“Is it a demon, boatman?”</p>

<p>"It's a ship. It's bigger than this one."</p>

<p>The situation was not optimistic because they were not demons. Just the other day, a large-scale naval battle had just occurred in the area. It would not be surprising if they encountered anything. In fact, Orban, staring into the darkness, uttered a name that is abhorred in the land of Myard.</p>

<p>“...... Craist ship, huh?”</p>

<p>“Damn it, at a time like this.”</p>

<p>"Are you going to run or fight?</p>

<p>A ship belonging to the enemy is approaching. This fact led the young men into a crucible of confusion. To their dismay, Aubin said to them in his usual tone of voice, "Don't be silly.</p>

<p>"Don't be silly, it's not a military ship. That's a fisherman. I've seen them before."</p>

<p>"Well, they were the ones who were killing each other until the other day.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. Fishermen don't fight when there's a good catch.</p>

<p>Oban quenched his throat with rum and called out into the darkness.</p>

<p>“You've come a long way!”</p>

<p>There was a slight delay, then a response.</p>

<p>“What, old Oban?”</p>

<p>"You're still alive, old duck, aren't you?</p>

<p>Unlike you, I'm far from dead. Unlike you, I'm far from dead, but I've had a rough time of it. The country is not so reliable. They thought they were going to war with you, but then they started fighting internally. There's nothing we can do about it."</p>

<p>"It was a nuisance. They were so busy doing all kinds of things that even the fish were too scared to catch them. “Pull over,” he said. "I picked up a ram. I'll split it with you.</p>

<p>"Sorry, we're in a tight spot here, and as far as I'm concerned, we don't have any food. I'll just have some cooked beans.</p>

<p>The two boatmen talked to each other smoothly. The rowers of both boats were bewildered, but they were already in no mood to fight each other. They rolled their weapons, which had lost their points, to the bottom of the boat and took hold of the oars. Then the rough rope was passed and the exchange began on the two boats, port side by port side.</p>

<p>“...... scrappy beans.”</p>

<p>Oban says without consideration as he stares at the beans in his hands. They are skinny and misshapen. They are stunted. Duck, the sender of the beans, is not offended by the scathing criticism of his exchange, but is rather proud of them.</p>

<p>Not only do they look bad, they taste bad, too.</p>

<p>“Sure, it's terrible, but it's filling.”</p>

<p>After chewing a mouthful, Aubin swallows the bean meal as if rinsing it with rum.</p>

<p>“Is the pickup going well?”</p>

<p>"Thanks for the guys on land, but they're making me a lot of money. How's it going over there?"</p>

<p>“Not so bad.”</p>

<p>“I wish the fishing was this easy.”</p>

<p>It's too easy. It's too easy. It's eerie.</p>

<p>"It's too easy. After all the fussing and baiting, the demons are awfully quiet.</p>

<p>No doubt.</p>

<p>As the two exchanged updates on the war, including the fishing grounds, Aubin glanced down at the water and asked his colleague, "What's going on with your boat?</p>

<p>“Are your boats still here?”</p>

<p>“We're the only ones around here.”</p>

<p>Although Duck was treated as a mere paddle compared to the old fisherman, he had been a fisherman for a long time. To age well in the demon-infested waters of Lake Celta, it was essential to have deceptive skill and good luck.</p>

<p>“Cut the rope, no hard feelings!”</p>

<p>Duck, instantly aware of the situation, followed the old fisherman's gaze and let out a cry that bordered on a scream.</p>

<p>"Ko, lakeshore dragon!　You guys paddle!"</p>

<p>The two skilled fishermen understood the situation correctly. It was out of the question that the two ships would be eaten together, but the victim would be the slower one. It doesn't have to be faster than the lake dragon. They only needed to be faster than the other one.</p>

<p>The crew rushed back to their posts and jumped to the oars, which were half-fastened with metal fittings.</p>

<p>“Just a few dozen, row as fast as you can!”</p>

<p>The young men reply to the old fisherman's proclamation. The smooth blades catch the surface of the water and the short boat glides along. Which is more attractive and easier to eat? If he were alone, Oban would have had no bite, but his two companions were meaty. The two passengers were more fleshy, and there was a risk that they would receive a less-than-pleasant evaluation.</p>

<p>The tightly tied ropes were untied one after another, and the folded sails were opened with a clatter. Maneuvering the ropes, they sat down, trying not to miss even the slightest breeze. The boatman looks at the lake dragon out of the corner of his eye and notices something strange.</p>

<p>“...... Hey, Duck wait!”</p>

<p>“Screw it, I don't want a will and testament, and I don't want to hear the end!”</p>

<p>“No, that's not it, that thing is dead.”</p>

<p>After a few seconds of clamor, the surface of the water is quiet again. For a drink, it was a great entertainment.</p>

<p>“Hah, you scared the shit out of me, you dead thing.”</p>

<p>“Shhhh, it's soooo big.”</p>

<p>The young people who had been shaken up were quickly changing, and now they were yelling and yelling at the silent lake dragons. Meanwhile, Dugg, who had been staring at the carcass, muttered to himself, "Hey, what's going to happen?</p>

<p>"Hey, what happened to me?</p>

<p>The ferocious lake dragons are cannibalistic among their own species and are engaged in territorial battles with other large species. Every so often, the carcasses of those who lose the competition end up on the ground. However, the way this lake dragon died was unusual even to the old fisherman's eyes. The lower half of its jaw, which was its pride, was missing, its huge body was torn apart like a piece of cheese, and its wounds were black and melted away. It was as if he had been impaled on a burnt-out steel tower.</p>

<p>"What about the three heroes at your place?　I bet they use some serious skills, don't they?"</p>

<p>"One of them escaped to your place, and one died in the war. The rest of them aren't here either.</p>

<p>Then who did this?</p>

<p>The Highserk guys, that's who did it. Demon Fire.</p>

<p>The blue flames of the imperial knight that burned down the inn town of Cape Raga could kill even a lake dragon. However, it is limited to the ground. Flames cannot invade water. Even a child knows this simple self-evident truth.</p>

<p>“I saw from the harbor that the ”Demon Fire" user scatters the wind of flame over a wide area. He wouldn't gouge such a huge body on the water, would he? Hey, are you listening to me?"</p>

<p>Oban wondered. Duck, nicknamed the “lightweight,” is a man who listens to others. Suddenly, he was not listening. He had never had the sensitivity to enjoy the stars.</p>

<p>"...... Hey, old man. I don't remember any reefs around here."</p>

<p>“Are you sleepwalking, ...... idiot, huh?”</p>

<p>Was it the alcohol that made him loose his head? Oban doubted the sanity of himself and others, but sure enough, there was a reef sticking out of the water. Instead of disappearing, the rock face was rising and rising. When the reef raised its sickle, the fisherman realized what it was.</p>

<p>“Ha, hah--”</p>

<p>“Don't make a noise, don't make a noise!”</p>

<p>Neither Dagg nor the young men made any noise. They had forgotten how to breathe and were drowning on the boat. The surface of the water turned red and murky, and the water boiled over. Reason overturned, the water burned. The surface of the lake, which should have been familiar, seemed like a gateway to the underworld.</p>

<p>I felt like I was having a bad dream. A nightmare of epic proportions. Who could have imagined such a scene? Who could have imagined that I was fighting a war on top of that thing?</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, you won't find him. It's not supposed to be found here."</p>

<p>The carcass of a lake dragon drifting on the surface of the water is crushed and swallowed into the bottom. A heated spray poured down, but no one screamed. The fishermen waited patiently, their voices muffled. The red reef disappeared like a phantom. The drifting short boat was no better than a fallen leaf.</p>

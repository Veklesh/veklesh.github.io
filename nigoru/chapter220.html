<p>Episode 66</p>

<p>The citadel in the water city of Ancushio, the great hall at the far end of the citadel has served as the headquarters of the Duchy of Myard's army since the outbreak of the war. The clothes of the chief vassals who are packed in the center of such a command function day after day are as withered as straw. As the key players in the management of the nation, they are expected to behave in an appropriate manner as role models for society. In normal times, even a wrinkle or a speck of dust on their clothes would not be tolerated, and they would be carefully removed, but their repeated hardships had robbed them of all leisure time to dress and care for their clothes.</p>

<p>Due to chronic fatigue and lack of sleep, the lower eyelids were stained a light black, giving the impression of hollowed pupils. Even his movements were deteriorating. His normally brisk movements are somehow sluggish and heavy like wet cotton.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of handling military aircraft, the opening and closing of windows and doors were restricted, and the air was stagnant and stagnant without adequate ventilation. It was not simply because the flow of outside air had been cut off. The repeated inferiority, the oppression of the current situation, and the dark emotions of the people mixed into the air and created a gloomy atmosphere. The wind blows in such a sedimented command center. Even a single report is filled with power, and the words that come and go are naturally filled with heat.</p>

<p>"The former Ferius militia of Kokurozaka, in the central part of the Zelebes Mountains, has turned over on the condition that they return to their old territory!　They also captured the head of a senior knight of Reharzen during the uprising."</p>

<p>"On the Orzelika slope, the enemy soldiers, mainly from the Yarkuk territory, have shown their reverence and are in a state of battle with the remaining Kingdom of Craist troops!</p>

<p>"A Jaff cavalry battalion rushes into the Craist army unit preparing to retreat from the Asarina slope. The Asarina garrison responded to this and launched a sortie!</p>

<p>The military officers were filled with life like beasts that had been unshackled from their cervix. They were struggling to fulfill their duties, their heads were burning, they were trying to find a way out of the situation, and they were exhausted by the impasse of the war. In such a situation, when the Jaff Cavalry Battalion broke through the siege, there was no one who was not on fire.</p>

<p>"The Kokurozaka garrison has wiped out the enemy forces from the attack. They will continue to move toward the adjacent Tarmakane area as ordered."</p>

<p>"The Kagatsu garrison is unable to launch a sortie due to lack of troops. The Kagatu garrison has not been able to launch a sortie due to lack of troops.</p>

<p>"Asarina, the garrison that has been launched from Koklo has captured the enemy forces retreating from the Talmakane Pass. Jaff's cavalry battalion and the Talmacane garrison have also joined the four units in the siege!</p>

<p>The men gathered in the command center looked solemn, but at the edges of their faces, they could not hide their excitement. It was truly a coup de grace to overturn the board, and the excitement of the military officers was understandable. But Rita Myard, the ruler of the Celta Peninsula, could not be mixed in with the excitement. No, she could not. Her eyes remained fixed on one of the pieces that had been removed from the board.</p>

<p>“...... I'm sure you're winning, but...”</p>

<p>At first glance, the piece looks like an ordinary piece. But it was enough to throw cold water on the Grand Duchess, who was on the verge of a frenzy of triumph. He did not want to dampen the morale of his liege lord and lady, who were buoyed up by the good news, but he did give a warning to himself inwardly. Just as the ice road had collapsed, the Duchy of Myard, which was reaching for victory, was standing on a fragile ice sheet.</p>

<p>One of the pieces removed from the lakeshore behind Laga was a mixed force of Highserk Imperial troops ordered to defend the town to the death at the inn. They had literally worn themselves out to buy time worth 10,000 gold to follow orders. In total, there were six hundred men, of whom only a platoon-sized number survived. Even the commander of the command, Captain Friug, was said to have perished upon the arrival of the imperial knights.</p>

<p>Rita did not know his face, his character, or what kind of person he was. All she has are idols called pawns and numbers as symbols. But they were alive. They were never mere numbers. If you become conceited about your position and stop seeing people as people, you will become a tyrant. Even if it is an escape to escape the burden of death.</p>

<p>They are not alone. Rita must continue to order the pieces on the table, correctly recognizing them as human beings, and imagining them as concrete people. This was her role and responsibility as a ruler. The map was busy with the movement and removal of pawns according to the war situation. Hiding the discomfort that clogged her chest, Rita asked one of the military officers who moved the pieces.</p>

<p>“What are the movements of the siege forces of Sarajevo Fortress and Kagatsuzaka?”</p>

<p>"Hah, both seem to be aiming at the traffic route used to move north and west of Kagatsuzaka. There is no sign of relief under siege."</p>

<p>He abandoned his leading friends who were surrounded by four columns. It was an action that could be considered cowardly, but in the big picture, it was not a mistake. He was painstakingly removed so as not to spread the necrosis of individual destruction throughout his body. The last deputy commander, who succeeded to the command, gave top priority to the gathering of troops scattered all over the country. He would be an excellent general who could see the board from a remote location. If the Yuigun, which was in the process of pulling out of the ice road and regrouping, had been a piece that could be moved at will, a counterattack with six empty mouths would not have been possible.</p>

<p>“The purpose of the rally was either a decisive battle or a retreat.”</p>

<p>The Imperial and Duchy forces were too fragile and weak to take the initiative. Rita, staring at the large map spread out, asked her confidant and advisor.</p>

<p>“Ratwidge, do you think you can push through like this?”</p>

<p>The old knight opened two or three breaths before answering.</p>

<p>"It's 50-50, including momentum. Whatever the outcome, if they collide, it will be fatal for both sides."</p>

<p>That was enough even for Rita, who was not familiar with military matters. Even if they won the decisive battle, how many pieces would be left?</p>

<p>"The enemy is concentrated north of Kagatsuzaka. Remnants of the army from Cape Raga and the Ice Road are also heading for the transportation route."</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Craist's army, which had been scattered to various locations, had gathered, albeit at great cost. Their number exceeded 13,000. It was a grand bluff involving the ruined Ferius. Even so, there were not enough troops, including those turned, to inflict a fatal blow. On the other hand, the forces of the Myard-Highserk Alliance were scattered inside and outside the outer line of the Zelebes Mountains, which also extended from the eastern edge to the western edge. The uneven distribution of forces. If they were discovered, the six mouths of the mountain would be eaten away this time.</p>

<p>Rita and the others gathered at the command center waited for further news. Would it be a bitter draw or a decisive battle to the death? The fluttering initiative was now in the hands of the Knights of Reharzen. A mage soldier operating a communication device looked up with a start. His expression was as if he had stopped breathing. Everyone realized that this was news that would affect the fate of the Celta Peninsula.</p>

<p>"The assembled enemy forces - they are retreating from the provisional border lines of Balboaad and Lanisfyre!　The Royal Army of Craist has begun to retreat!"</p>

<p>A cry that could be described as either relief or jubilation echoed through the hall. It did not last long. When the oldest military officer, Ratwidge, complained, the command center immediately regained its traditional functions.</p>

<p>"That's enough rejoicing. Nothing is over yet."</p>

<p>"Lord Latwidge is right. The retreat may be a false move. We are on the front foot, and there may be a renewed offensive."</p>

<p>Do not move the garrisons in Sarajevo and Refn yet. Keep them where they are."</p>

<p>"Move the units that have been sent out inside the mountainous outer perimeter. Be especially careful with the turned Ferians. Now that they have no country, they can choose whatever they want.</p>

<p>"In the Yarukuk territory, they have shown reverence in exchange for the head of the head of the family. The lords of Barbasec have fled to Craist."</p>

<p>It was too nihilistic to call it a victory. The price paid in men was half the enemy field force. The country was devastated, and the men and materials for reconstruction were wasted. But it was not worthless. Military power was not something that only worked externally. The exiles and demon fiefdoms that the Kingdom of Craist had suppressed with its military might began to rage out of control. They have been paralyzed and will suffer from now on. Rita, who has experienced the quagmire of reconstruction, understands it well. There is no cure for this kind of problem. The only thing to do is to hope for the best solution, scratch at the seaweed, and endure.</p>

<p>While Rita was lost in thought, her eyes met those of a soldier sitting in the middle of a large desk, and she gasped. It was Justus, the brigade commander of the Myard-resident Highserk Imperial Guard. He said nothing. He just stared at the Grand Duke.</p>

<p>The silence spoke eloquently of their mutual feelings. Whatever they said would be cheap words now. The imperial army had answered faith with action. Now it was the Duchy of Myard's turn to show by action. Rita looked at the piece that represented the Highserk troops that had been the cornerstone of both countries and quietly said.</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you.”</p>

<p>The piece, which was removed from the board, also gave no answer. It simply lay there quietly.</p>

<p>The pieces were removed from the board, too, and simply lay there quietly.</p>

<p>In the half-destroyed frontline treatment center, Walm looked at the body lying there and a sword. It was war. Dead bodies and swords are not uncommon. Even so, he could not get used to the sight of the body and belongings of an acquaintance. The body belonged to Justan, a Kingsguard of the former Kingdom of Ferius. The body had sustained fatal wounds in various places, and there was no place where he was safe. Despite such a spectacular death in battle, the former Kingsguard looked somewhat satisfied.</p>

<p>“Shortly after we parted, he breathed his last.”</p>

<p>Maia tried not to show her upset, but it was easy to see through her swollen face that she was faking.</p>

<p>"What's the big deal? You're dead."</p>

<p>The imperial knight mutters, as if blaming the last exchange he had with Justan. He knew it was a bluff. There was no way he could have survived that fatal wound. Still, somewhere in his heart, he had not given up. What had he expected? Walm asked about the owner of the sword that lay quietly beside the former Kingsguard.</p>

<p>“Friug's corpse,” he said.</p>

<p>"Guided by the luring fire to the underworld. Only the sword."</p>

<p>“Well, I guess it didn't burn and leave behind.”</p>

<p>Mauritz, who had been in contact with other survivors of Dandurg Castle, replied, slurring his words. This, too, was understandable. Understandably, Walm burned the enemy with them. There was no way that any part of the bodies remained unburned. Even the ashes had burned away, stirred up by the wind and flames.</p>

<p>“Mister Walm -- well, excuse me, but you must be tired.”</p>

<p>"...... me?　I'm, I'm fine. You have nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>The imperial knight shakes his head and rejects Moritz's concern. There was still work to be done. This was no time to rest.</p>

<p>"Let me talk to Ayane alone for a moment. There is something we need to talk about."</p>

<p>No one objected. Away from the morgue of the dead, Walm was alone with the girl from his hometown. The words he had been thinking about how to tell her were not coming out well. He could not lie to the girl, who was waiting for him silently, not rushing him. No lie would be tolerated, no embellished facts.</p>

<p>“Yuto is dead.”</p>

<p>"Is that so? Youto is ......."</p>

<p>Ayane was not distraught, perhaps sensing this from the rumors on the battlefield. The girl kept her mouth tightly knit and her eyes sadly downcast.</p>

<p>"Me, I set her up. I knew he was Ayane's childhood friend, but I disturbed him by saying he was my compatriot, and I killed him."</p>

<p>The words were choppy, but he was able to finish them. My footing was as unsteady as if I were on an incline. I don't intend to run away without a back and forth. Walm put his strength into his belly, biting his back teeth to keep himself upright in pain. I am ready for the abuse and the hate.</p>

<p>"...... Walm, I understand. I couldn't help it, couldn't I?"</p>

<p>The warm, gentle smile was painful. I would rather have been beaten. It was still more bearable to be called a bastard and rejected.</p>

<p>"Stop it. Even if he acted like an adult, he was still a kid, Youto was still a kid. He's at the age where he's wondering how he's going to live the rest of his life. I can't help it. ......"</p>

<p>He was old enough to have his values of right and wrong easily swayed. In the world of the past, we would be wondering how we were going to live the rest of our lives. There was a future. Walm had ended that possibility.</p>

<p>"He said he wanted to go home when he was dying. And Ayane and Makoto's names--"</p>

<p>Even after hearing these tragic words, Ayane does not change her soft smile. I shouldn't have said it. But I couldn't stop her. The feelings that had been suppressed for so long leaked out helplessly.</p>

<p>"You are different from me. Even though I have memories of my previous life, I was born and spent time in this world. Since I was a child, I had enough time to give up on what I couldn't do. There was grace."</p>

<p>The girl said nothing. She just stared into her clouded eyes.</p>

<p>"Only those around me die. Friug, too, and Justan. They're called imperial knights, but in the end, they've killed before they were killed. That's all. I have survived by using countless corpses as a springboard. They were shallow and pretentious in front of their countrymen, but their true nature is like this. You understand."</p>

<p>I don't remember everything I said. When Walm had run out of words to spit out, the girl finally spoke up.</p>

<p>"I, on the contrary, was relieved. I heard that it's hard for you, too, Walm."</p>

<p>"Stop it. Ayane, I--"</p>

<p>The girl continued to interrupt the imperial knight.</p>

<p>"No matter what anyone says, or what you yourself say, Walm-san is a serious, good person. I, Maia, Friug, and many others were saved by the imperial knight. You were hurt, and now I want to help you. I want to help you."</p>

<p>“Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.”</p>

<p>Her throat choked and she was unable to speak. Walm shook his head again and again, like a child. He is not worth it. He is a man who is only capable of killing people. Ayane smiles at the imperial knight, who tries to deny it.</p>

<p>"When you are in pain, it is better to cry. That's how people are."</p>

<p>She covered her face with her trembling arms and crouched round. That was the last resistance the imperial knight could make. After killing and being killed so many times, how could he expect to have a future, or any other human emotion? No such right was allowed. The emotions that had been paralyzed in order to adapt to the current situation became confused. I tried to hide my face and heart with Demon Mask, but even the girl could see through it.</p>

<p>There was a shadow overhead and a sweet scent. Something soft touched the hardened outer skin. A body that had known only heat and pain was bewildered by the sudden appearance of a furtive repose.</p>

<p>“Aya, ne what ......?”</p>

<p>"I just want to do this for a little while. It's okay."</p>

<p>There was no way she could refuse. Walm relaxed from his stiff body. It was an escape from reality. Nothing would change. Still, for this moment, this one time, he wanted to forget. There is no heavy burden of armor that weighs on his body and soul, no cold weapon that can sap his life. There is only the soft arm that runs down my back, the small sound of my breathing, and the pleasant beat of my heart. Emotions were breaking down. Walm buried his head in the girl's belly.</p>

<p>Episode 58</p>

<p>The convoy succeeded in pushing through part of the encirclement, but the breakthrough was aborted without success. In the sparse forest that stretches east-southeast from the treatment center, the corpses of guard soldiers and wounded soldiers are left behind as if they were road signs. The remains of the guard soldiers and wounded soldiers lay discarded like signposts in the sparse forests spreading out to the southeast of the treatment center, with Craist soldiers who had died together beside them. Such an escape to death is blocked by a bank and a stream so high that one can hardly look up. The convoy, reduced to less than the fingers of their hands after the battle to the death, scrambled for the last time.</p>

<p>“Pushed in, huh?”</p>

<p>Despite their exhaustion, more than thirty Craist soldiers closed the circle of encirclement and closed in on them. Justin slams down flying arrows with his sword, and what he can't dodge, he uses his armor to block. A dull pain shoots through his chestplate, but the pointed arrow doesn't penetrate and slides away.</p>

<p>“Enough, you're going to die!”</p>

<p>The swearing archer reaches for his quiver, but there are none left. With a cluck of his tongue, the enemy soldier discards his bow and arrow casing and draws his sword. Now he can no longer be shot through with arrows. The enemy's mage soldiers are either dead, wounded, or out of magic power. The reason they were not killed in a single breath was, to a large extent, the dedication of the soldiers and, ironically, the water currents that blocked the convoy's path. The stream, where timber drift takes place when the water rises, augments water-based magic.</p>

<p>Maia is not a regular mage, but she has a powerful water attribute. If Justan and his men serve as the vanguard and operate as a fixed point of fire, they can call in catastrophic battle results. In this way, the convoys would pursue soldiers who felled by water bullets and put a stop to those who were wounded by ice spears.</p>

<p>“Abominable!!!!”</p>

<p>“Ayane must have gotten mixed up with the mooks.”</p>

<p>Her most significant battle feat was when she removed her hood and discarded her disguise. It is not every day that one sees the fool face of a knight from Reharzen who has come after the disguised Maia, believing her to be a rare healer and sorceress. But no matter how much he laughed, he had only avenged a blow, and the predicament continued.</p>

<p>“At last, is it?”</p>

<p>Douglas, his subordinate, lamented, not hiding his accumulated fatigue.</p>

<p>"That's pessimistic. At least we won't be shot dead."</p>

<p>Losing their projectile weapons, they lost the means to chip away at the convoy without damage. But the Craist soldiers were neither lazy nor pacifist enough to respond to a leisurely standoff. As the circle of people slowly shrank, Maia threatened them with water magic, but the water popped behind her. It was not a rumbling water bullet. That fleeting splash was the sound of a water ball disintegrating into the surface of the water in the process of formation.</p>

<p>“Mr. Justan!”</p>

<p>Justan understood the situation only from the voice of his escort. The fuel was finally running out. At the same time, it was also the end of the curtain. Against the backdrop of the escort team, who had once again made up their minds, the knight of Reharzen ordered, as if to relieve his exasperation.</p>

<p>"All hands, on!</p>

<p>Like unleashed hounds, Craist's soldiers rush in. We must reduce their numbers at all costs. If they were too patient, they would only hasten their deaths. The first to take the lead was the archer, who had abandoned his bow and become a lightweight. Justin kicked the surface of the water with his feet, which were attached like roots.</p>

<p>“What--!”</p>

<p>The archer, who had assumed that he was an immobile opponent, fell behind. Against the incomplete slash with the timing off, Justan responded with his sword with all his might. The short sword of the archer, who had originally abandoned his bow, missed the pause. There was no reason why he could not win. The arm jumped up, defeated by the pressure of the sword. Justin cut back his wrists and delivered a slash to the gap between his elbows. The ford turns vermilion, and the archer with his throat ripped open walks unsteadily. The spearmen following him try to rally in the nick of time.</p>

<p>“Huh, huh--”</p>

<p>Breathing and feet, don't stop. Justan pushes back the archer who has entered the underworld halfway. The ear pierced the body of the archer who interrupted his thrust. The Craist soldier, who had unexpectedly put a stop to his friend's soldier, hurriedly pulled out his spear. However, the tip of the spear entered through the flank, ripped through skin and muscle, and stopped at the inner ribs. It was a struggle to pull out a spear stuck in bone.</p>

<p>Against the enemy soldiers who clung to their spears, Justan's target was simple. He leapt from the shadow of the archer and swung his sword along the hilt. The startled spearman tried to fire a freshly drawn spear at him, but he was too close to strike. The blade of the sword, which had eaten through his helmet and side of his head, ate his brain. Without seeing the end of it, Justan greets his next opponent.</p>

<p>One of the newcomers holds a hammer and pike, the other a sword and shield. The sword was a real nuisance to check the newcomers while they were fortifying themselves. Moreover, if they were too close to the shield-bearer, they would receive a hammering spear from the side. If he took his time, he would be able to cut them down, but he could not afford such luxury. Justin took their invitation head-on. With a thrust, he turns to the left side of the shield-bearer and jumps into the gap between them. The thrust was blocked by the shield, and the shield-bearer, half-turning on the axis of his left leg, thrust back with his sword. Justin caught the thrust coming right in front of him with his tsuba, and continued to advance.</p>

<p>“I'm going to pinch you!”</p>

<p>The hammering spearman tried to regain his position as his comrade-in-arms called out, but he was just a little too late. Justan stepped sharply onto his right foot and stepped through the ankle. The sole of his shoe responded well.</p>

<p>“Ggh!”</p>

<p>The shield-bearer wants to keep his shaft foot in front of him. He tries to push the former kinsman away with his shield, but one leg, which was supporting an excessive amount of weight, is unable to step on it. The remaining short sword is also in the midst of a brute force battle. Against the impatient enemy soldiers, Justin's body moved as he had been taught repeatedly in the past.</p>

<p>The elite and renowned Kingsguard of Ferius has mastered the art of warfare when he has to let go of his weapon in the midst of battle. He was free enough, even if he could not swing his fists in close contact. With a small pull of his left shoulder and gaining a narrow space, Justin swung his arm through the air. The elbow, which got a helping hand, shattered between the eyebrows of the enemy soldier who was in close contact with him.</p>

<p>“Geeeeaaaah!!!?”</p>

<p>It was not just an elbow strike. When it comes to the end of the cuirass, it is powerful enough to break a person. The shield-bearer, having lost his vision and sense of equilibrium, began playing with water like an innocent toddler. So far, so good. But a price is looming. Justin grits his teeth and assesses the trajectory of the hammerhead.</p>

<p>“G-G-G-G-GHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”</p>

<p>It was a blow to the head, as it should be. Justin's mace swung vertically, and he brought his helmet along with it. A dull pain echoed through the helmet. The pain was so intense that it felt as if his cheek was burning from his right ear, and the impact finally stopped at his shoulder. Their gazes meet through the mace.</p>

<p>Instantly, the former Konoe swung his sword. The lightness of his touch made him realize he had failed. Had the blow to the head slowed him down? He had intended to sever the throat by the wrist, but he could only cut it in half. Covering the wound with an imperfect magical membrane, he slashes again at the enemy soldier, who tries to draw his sword with the opposite hand.</p>

<p>“Damn it!”</p>

<p>The sword body slashed down from the upper level, this time not allowing any resistance, and cut off his head. The head bounced on the surface of the water like a stone cutter. After that, his memory was vague. I don't remember how we fought or how many people we killed. Just as he was twisting Craist's intestines around with his sword, Justin snapped back to reality. He was missing from his left elbow and beyond. Sensation in the right half of his face was gone. Hearing sound was also indistinct. His body was on fire, but he was inexplicably cold.</p>

<p>"What, man? What was I, doing?"</p>

<p>Justin asks himself, remembering that he is a Kingsguard. The Kingsguard must protect the nation with its own body. Where is the target of the guard, where are the troops? He must protect them - this time. Color came into his clouded consciousness.</p>

<p>The stream, which had been so lively, is now dominated only by the sound of ragged breathing and the sound of the river flowing. The number of remaining enemies is down to ten. We are almost there. How many allies are left? Looking around, Justan spotted one of his familiar subordinates.</p>

<p>“What, you're sitting there, the enemy is still here.”</p>

<p>“So, you're still alive, Felius' Kingsguard is mostly crazy.”</p>

<p>“You, a Highserk, you say, ...... Hey, Douglas.”</p>

<p>Justan notices in the light exchange of words. The soldier, who was sitting cross-legged and drooping, had a spear broken from the base growing out of his abdomen. The location of the punctured hole was the liver, and he was unaware of his subordinate's fatal wound. As if concerned about his silent former Kingsguard, Douglas mutters.</p>

<p>"Haha, no good, right, this. After you, shush, rei."</p>

<p>“...... Oh, just wait a bit.”</p>

<p>This left only one remaining convoy. And it wasn't just Justan who was watching them die.</p>

<p>“Dead, or resisting in vain,” he said.</p>

<p>“How many people did these guys kill?”</p>

<p>They talk as if it were all over. The guards are still alive, as are the targets they are supposed to protect. Nothing is over yet. The knights of Reharzen are not moving, but are still in the distance as Justin takes up a stance. Blood continues to flow from the loosened magical membrane to their feet.</p>

<p>“Maia, you fool.”</p>

<p>As if nothing is wrong, the knights of Rehazen resume their conversation. Aha, suddenly Justan realizes. These guys are just asking and answering questions to pass the time. Until they run out of power. The healer understands this, and is unwilling to go along with them.</p>

<p>"I don't want to be called stupid by those of you who would kill a single girl.</p>

<p>"If she's just a girl. That thing's healing magic is as threatening as a thousand soldiers. A fellow healer would have understood that."</p>

<p>“How dare you betray the Order that took you in as an orphan and gave you food, clothing, shelter, and even an education?”</p>

<p>“If you hadn't started another war, ...... you wouldn't have betrayed us.”</p>

<p>“It's a big picture decision.”</p>

<p>"The way you say it. You sound like a little Gran."</p>

<p>To Maia's sarcasm, the knight of Reharzen continues his self-indulgent conversation without changing a single expression on his face. Justan can only listen in silence. Even the breath of a single word is lifeless.</p>

<p>“Is the will only flattery?”</p>

<p>"Enough. It would be barren to exchange words."</p>

<p>"The soldiers who fled also sent their pursuers after them. Ayane will die soon. You have wasted your time.</p>

<p>I understand that they can see right through me. Still, now Justan had no choice but to play along with their games.</p>

<p>"What about Maia? Should we just take her head and go home?"</p>

<p>"It's bad for Yout's education. I don't want him to see the corpse. I'll kill him here and smash his face."</p>

<p>The earth distorts. Justan, who was supposed to be holding his ground, was on his knees before he knew it.</p>

<p>"No more, no more, no more. You don't have to protect me anymore."</p>

<p>Maia, who was behind him, whispered softly. It was no good. Then again, I would not be able to protect anything, as I had done in my homeland, Felius. Against his will, Justan's body did not even twitch.</p>

<p>“It's about time.”</p>

<p>“It's about time,” he said, "as foolish as it is, it's the least I can do for my former compatriot. I'll kill you with ease."</p>

<p>Finally, the underworld's welcome has arrived. The blood-sucking reaper was visible through a gap in the sparse forest.</p>

<p>“This time, this time, oh my god!”</p>

<p>“Still moving!”</p>

<p>The knights of Reharzen stopped in surprise as the former Kingsguard suddenly jumped up. Justan ignored them, hugged Maia, and jumped into the stream. The shallow water reflected the blue sky. A dark, murky blue stained such a clear blue. After a pause of ten breaths, Justin climbs out of the water. The sparse forest was ablaze, and both the living and the dead in the shallows were lighting an azure bonfire. Then he asks the reaper.</p>

<p>“Ay, where is the Lady Ne?”</p>

<p>“Ay, ne has joined the reinforcements from the pass.”</p>

<p>“I see, this time.”</p>

<p>The imperial knight calls out to Justan, who mutters under his breath, and extends his hand.</p>

<p>“Hold on, we'll get you out of here...”</p>

<p>It's obvious he won't last that long. Walm does his best to encourage the former Kingsguard. What a kind and cruel man.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about me. It's no big deal. Burn the enemy. Save Myard."</p>

<p>Justan used his last ounce of energy to remove Walm's bewildered hand. Human hands are limited. There was no room to grab anything unnecessary.</p>

<p>“I'm sorry.”</p>

<p>He stared at the imperial knight's back as he moved away from him. He is a good man. If Walm had not been born in the empire, if he had been born in the kingdom of Felius, surely his country would not have been destroyed. If Ratu, the guardian general who was not found in Yarkuk, were to join him there, Ferius would surely have a hundred years of glory.</p>

<p>Justin thought of the scene of them and the Kingsguard standing shoulder to shoulder on the battlefield and mocked himself. It is too improbable a future. How could he have felt a kindred spirit toward the Highserk, whom he had always disliked? It must be the end of the line. Above his head, Maia was repeatedly shouting something. I feel softness and warmth in the coldness. Douglas and the others who had crossed into the underworld earlier would be envious. How can I apologize? Justin's thoughts faded as he floated an excuse. And so the life of the former Kingsguard of Ferius burns away and turns to ashes.</p>

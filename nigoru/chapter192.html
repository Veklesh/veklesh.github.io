<p>The Kingdom of Craist, having conquered the provisional border line by surprise and burial, divides its army into three large groups and launches a full-scale invasion into the territory controlled by the Duchy of Myard. The main forces blocked the six mouths of Zelebes and succeeded in cutting off the lines of communication to the outside of the peninsula. The remaining two forces concentrate on capturing the Duchy's garrisoned units in Sarajevo and Refun, which have a large number of troops, and conduct actions to prevent them from moving and merging with the Duchy.</p>

<p>The Duchy of Myard and the Highserk Imperial Guard, which were inferior in military strength and had seized the initiative, decided that a counterattack was impossible at this stage. While setting up a defensive line along the outer perimeter of the Zelebes Mountains, the remaining troops and civilians who were defeated from the border area were to be accommodated in Celta through delaying tactics by a standing army capable of immediate response.</p>

<p>In addition, a counterattack from the edge of the enemy encirclement was considered against the Kingdom of Craist's forces, which were divided at the blockade of the Six Gates of Zerebeth, but due to a lack of troops and information, and the danger of being caught out, an aggressive mobile defense was abandoned.</p>

<p>The Duchy of Myard crushed the offensive on the outer line of the Zerebeth Mountains, stalling for time and awaiting reinforcements from the mainland of the Highserk Empire to engage in a decisive battle. On the other hand, the Kingdom of Craist, which had seized the initiative through preemptive action and division of the country, was aiming to subdue Myard by preparing multiple options, including a forceful attack on Celta, a decisive battle in the field, and a long-term battle with a fortified castle.</p>

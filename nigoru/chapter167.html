<p>Episode 14</p>

<p>The sails, caught by the lake winds, were taut and unrelaxed, turning wind power into propulsion for the ship. The opposite shore of Celta, a huge lake, was hidden by the horizon and could not be seen even from the deck. The light infantry squadron, accompanied by Walm, was divided into one warship and two merchant vessels, and set sail for the port city of Ancusio, the center of the Celta peninsula.</p>

<p>Unlike the open sea, the waves on the lake were relatively calm. Still, it is a harsh environment for infantrymen who have spent most of their lives on land, and many of them suffer from severe seasickness. Even Friug's complexion was not good, although he did not show it. That is understandable. Many of the men are not familiar with the water, and half of the infantry cannot even swim. The current situation in the homeland is that there are no professionals close to the water, nor do they have the background to learn how to swim. The Highserk Imperial Army, which boasts of its strength on the ground, is no different from the Sahagin on the chopping block on the lake.</p>

<p>Originally, the Highserk Empire was a small force located inland that expanded its territory after a defensive war and annexed neighboring countries with impunity. The homeland, lacking resources and funds, had no choice but to devote itself to the army. Even after a period of expansion and the acquisition of territory bordering the sea, it had a history of being held back by the Liberitoa Trade Federation Navy outside the bay and the navy of Myard on Lake Celta.</p>

<p>Looking aft, the following ships follow in single file. Unlike the flagship with Walm on board, the two slightly smaller ships were not purely combat vessels, but were classified as merchant ships. Due to the size of the ship, some of the sails of the flagship are folded down, whereas all the sails of the merchant ship are set. This is to ensure consistency in speed.</p>

<p>In addition, the draft lines of the two following vessels are sunk significantly because of the miscellaneous cargo they are carrying in addition to the Highserk soldiers. The sound of packed livestock arrives on the wind. It is unfortunate, but the soldiers are probably suffering from the smell and the sound of the livestock by now. Walm had learned from experience that ships are busier when they are leaving and coming into port. Conversely, while underway, extra manpower and space are created. Rather than join the groaning soldiers on the middle deck, it was more useful to find a gap on the deck out of the sailors' way and pass the time by looking out at the lake's surface, which never changed.</p>

<p>“Hey, you look pretty cool.”</p>

<p>I looked at the owner of the voice and saw a sailor standing there with a scowl on his face. I couldn't tell whether he was in a bad mood or whether he had always had that look. If I could say one thing, it is that he has the distinctive air of someone who is backed by experience and skill.</p>

<p>“I'm just a bit confused on a ship I'm not used to.”</p>

<p>"Tell a better lie. His face is nauseous and uncanny, and there is no sign of wind. His center of gravity on deck is reasonable for a man in armor. The other infantrymen are making noise from the shaking, and they're taking off their armor."</p>

<p>I'm sorry to say it, but I could see right through him. Like many sailors, this man would be a handful on the water who would not tolerate being made to look big by a landsman. In addition, unlike the land forces, which had suffered a series of defeats throughout Myard, the Celta navy had made some moves to push back Highserk, albeit to a limited extent. They have that pride. Therefore, it is natural for them to have a certain spirit of rebellion and rebelliousness. Until that spirit turns into clear hostilities, they can simply be said to be a group with a strong habit and core. Walm was not averse to such a handful.</p>

<p>“Are you really an infantryman?”</p>

<p>Walm was not about to let his strange suspicions get the better of him.</p>

<p>"I spent a month or so sailing around the archipelago while I was away from the army. I guess that makes me look familiar."</p>

<p>"So Highserk soldiers these days are venturing out to the open sea? It's odd. ...... I hear that the merchant ships of the archipelagic countries are heavily armed."</p>

<p>"Compared to Highserk's small boats, which can't even navigate small rivers, they are the difference between a dragon and a kobold. The stern towers were heavily layered, and the number of large crossbowmen equipped with them was off the charts. The number of maritime magicians was also one squadron on board, although they were used for both sailors and sailors."</p>

<p>"A merchant ship with that kind of armament? Hmmm...only the champion of a maritime nation would have that kind of armament. How do they compare with the warships of Celta?"</p>

<p>“I'm an amateur at surface combat...”</p>

<p>Unlike land combat, naval combat was not Walm's area of expertise as an infantryman. He thought of the Adelina to consider as he spoke of the preliminaries.</p>

<p>"If it's a white battle, the difference in the number of sailors will be enough to push them, but if they keep their distance, they will be pushed by the difference in the ship's performance. There were also several drainage systems in place. Even if they cut a hole in the hull, it would only be a slight incline."</p>

<p>"You say that without consideration ...... No, wait, holes in the hull?　You had a battle?"</p>

<p>“Yeah, a demon attack.”</p>

<p>What did it look like?</p>

<p>"Yeah, a medium sized Kraken and a bunch of Sahaghins. They were nasty to kill and smelled so bad it stung my eyes."</p>

<p>Their physical strength and massive size, which caused serious damage to the hull and personnel, were a threat, but they were also a pain in the ass to clean up after. The rotten-smelling mucous membranes and organs made them lose their noses for a while. Many complained of headaches, and in the face of that stench, the sewage at the bottom of the ship might have been somewhat better.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as an aquatic demon that doesn't smell. A kraken, albeit a medium-sized one. It's a demon you won't see in Lake Celta. Tell me more about it."</p>

<p>There was no reason to refuse. I was getting tired of watching the unchanging surface of the water and the waterfowl passing by. Walm recounted a series of events.</p>

<p>“They've got a lot of nerve to let their passengers use fire magic,” he said. We'd have kicked you into the lake if we'd burned your boat."</p>

<p>“Was it true that the kraken would appear with the stench of decay?”</p>

<p>“Whether in the sea or in the lake, Sahagin's guts must stink.”</p>

<p>Before I knew it, other sailors with time on their hands had joined the conversation. After finishing his explanation, Walm, tired of talking, switched positions and asked the sailors about the most famous demon in Lake Celta.</p>

<p>“By the way, what kind of demon is the lake dragon?”</p>

<p>"Simply put, it's a semi-aquatic dragon. It wanders around the water's edge in search of food with its ridiculously large mouth open. They are not an easy opponent, but their skins are flexible, waterproof, and versatile. It would be a treasure trove if we could hunt them."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. While on land, they are slow and easy targets. While they are in the water, on the other hand, they are agile and can be tricky. Well, don't worry. They're used to fighting, and they're very quiet right now."</p>

<p>“Is it breeding season?”</p>

<p>No, it's not. I don't know for sure, but the change of masters must have had an effect. The previous master was so ferocious that he even used the floating city of Liberitoa as a feeding ground. They're busy fighting over territory that their own people have vacated."</p>

<p>“So the demons are as busy fighting as the ...... people?”</p>

<p>Just as people are competing for land, there is also a fierce, endless competition for survival in the waters of Lake Celta.</p>

<p>“It's time to get into position and enter the harbor directly!”</p>

<p>A distinctive, sullen voice of a sailor echoed from the top of the stern tower. The assembled sailors dispersed to their posts as if a fog had lifted. Leaning over the railing and looking into the distance, one can see the tip of a peninsula jutting out sharply like a knife. Celta, which had been hiding on the horizon, finally came into view. The bow turns to port around the tip.</p>

<p>“I guess it's time for me to go.”</p>

<p>The deck and mast began to look as crowded as a harvest festival. Shoals and complicated winds kept the sails busy adjusting as land approached. It would be a shame to get kicked off into the lake for interfering with their work. Walm decided to make a strategic retreat and ran down the steeply angled stairs. It was really not made in a human-friendly way.</p>

<p>“Hey, look, land!”</p>

<p>“Is that the tip of Celta's sword?”</p>

<p>Finally, we can get rid of this hold.</p>

<p>Soldiers look out of the windows in the hull of the ship. Their voices and faces are filled with life at the sight of the long-awaited land. Walm joins them, quietly waiting for the ship to come into port.</p>

<p>Episode 47</p>

<p>To unravel the complex and tangled threads of an army, neither neat tactics nor superior warfare could provide a solution. The only decisive factor is pure violence to tear the threads apart, was the theory of Yorgim, who was in charge of a platoon on Orsellica Hill.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid, if you back down here, you'll just die anyway!</p>

<p>His familiar voice echoed well in the melee. His bulging biceps femoris kicked up the earth, and his pulsating biceps brachii pushed out his fists. Her blonde hair, which follows her agile movements, sways in waves and does not lose its luster even on a gruesome battlefield. Her sharp, narrowed eyes glamorously and provocatively aim at the enemy. Many people target a stalwart wife. It is a natural duty of a husband to get rid of the tactless ones. Yogim, interrupting his body, scoops up the tip of the spear aiming at Deborah's left flank with his sword spine, turns his wrist, and rips out her throat.</p>

<p>"You!　I can handle that much!"</p>

<p>Deborah said bluntly, and then delivered a hammering spear to her new hand. The raised round shield is eaten through like candy, scattering pieces of reinforcing wood. The enemy soldier thrusts with his remaining arm, but the magical membrane, sublimated to the skill “Vajra,” plays off the unarmed sword as if it were a twig. With a blow to the temple, the soldier stumbled to the ground.</p>

<p>With his wife in his sights, Yogim changes the directionality of the swords fighting each other and slides his sword blade. With a high-pitched tone that scraped through the steel, the blade sliced through his inner wrist. The Ferius soldier let go of his weapon and quickly covered his neck, the vital spot. It was a reasonable decision to protect his unprotected neck, but he had raised his elbow too high. If a longsword was inserted into the exposed side, the enemy soldier would fall down with a look of anguish on his face. If he had lowered his guard, he could have made a move or two. In a melee, that kind of effort can be fatal, as I had learned in my long life as an adventurer.</p>

<p>“There's no end to this!”</p>

<p>Contrary to her earlier words, the shy wife shifted half her body and completely put her back to him. Yogim is not wild enough to mention it. They wielded their weapons at a distance that did not impede each other's movements. Those who tried to separate them in death were tossed about by the couple's feints and exposed their wreckage.</p>

<p>A desperate attempt to throw a projectile is repelled by Deborah's magical membrane and knocked down by Yogim's sword. The “intuition” is based on a myriad of empirical predictions. Compared to his wife's “rigid” and ‘rigid’ skills, which affect the body, “intuition” is modest, but it is useful to match the initial movement of the attacker before the attack.</p>

<p>Dropping to his knees and leaning forward, Yogim stepped forward without any preliminary movement. The soles of his shoes, which dug deeply into the ground, converted the kick into thrust without excess. The Ferius soldiers' faces twisted as their husband, who had been keeping pace with them until then, slashed at them. One of them, who had been preparing for the slash after the projectile, raised his sword, while the other kept his short spear drawn. No great force was needed. A small flick of the wrist up and down, as if swinging a fishing rod. The two men writhed as if they had stepped on a nail and held their throats as blood spurted out.</p>

<p>"Kill them!</p>

<p>Yogim takes a step or two back, shot through with a murderous intent by the remaining enemy. Countless blades loomed in front of him. If he took one more step, he would be entangled in the deadly blades. Even so, he was in no hurry. The reliable wind pressure and shadows on his back brought that much peace of mind.</p>

<p>“Don't retreat!”</p>

<p>The Ferius soldiers who had been crowded together were reaped off by the mace. The armor of those who received a direct hit was crushed as if run over by a wild boar, and those who received the aftermath were thrown to the ground. Yogim mowed down the soldiers who were flustered by the impact from overhead. A stroke of the sky shows a vermilion trail of blood glued to the sword.</p>

<p>"I've always had a habit of jumping in too fast, and I'll never get rid of it!</p>

<p>Haha, you'll probably follow me somehow."</p>

<p>“Don't be silly!”</p>

<p>Yorgim is satisfied with the way the couple moves together on the battlefield. He laughs off his wife's reprimands. At the same time, he is filled with nostalgia.</p>

<p>“This reminds me of when I was young.”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about at a time like this!”</p>

<p>This is not a situation in which you can talk lightly. The earthworks were nearly breached, and a melee ensued between friend and foe. The reliable imperial knight was in a battle with the enemy's fierce general, and the Reharzen knights, including the notorious deputy commander Sylance, stood in front of the couple. Rumors were circulating in Celta that the couple had gone to great lengths in their attempts to cut off the demon territory and capture the old Ferius forces. It could be said that they were in a tight spot.</p>

<p>Still, the calls exchanged as if to confirm each other brought back memories of my fading youth. It is too bloody to reminisce about the relationship that once made them husband and wife. Still, it is the time they have lived. No matter how they tried to mend it, they would never recall it in a peaceful world.</p>

<p>“It's times like this, isn't it?”</p>

<p>“You've always been more reckless than me.”</p>

<p>The blood spilled on the battlefield is gruesome and inescapable. I have no intention of getting drunk on the bloodshed. But it is also true that there is a fascination about wives that can only be experienced there, and an excitement that can only be achieved there. Just as in the past when they met on the battlefield, spears passing through their backs, arrows snatching at each other, and angry shouts awakening their dormant fighting spirit. They make the most of each other's strengths and counteract each other's weaknesses. It is more heartening than any joint effort.</p>

<p>“You can't let my son see this.”</p>

<p>Yogim, showing his canine teeth ferociously, mocks himself alone. Although her usual behavior and appearance are described as unreliable, she is aware that in the midst of war, they are indeed a couple of like-minded people. This commonality is also her husband's secret pleasure.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Walm will say I'm overprotective,” Deborah says in disgust.</p>

<p>Deborah says in disgust. I don't have to say it out loud. Moyes is their child. He was beaten up by one of the best knights in the Highserk empire. It must be time for him to peel off his skin after leaving his parents' hands. Yorgim was filled with a touch of loneliness, but there was no time for sentimentality.</p>

<p>“Don't talk about unbearable love stories on the battlefield!”</p>

<p>An agitated voice, out of place in the midst of family time, rang out. It was Sylance, Deputy Commander of the Knights of Reharzen, who was leading the general attack on the cut-throat. The commander's work was limited in such a small area of melee. He must have come out to eliminate the threat directly. Deborah, an attractive woman, is always accompanied by an interloper. Yogim is used to escorting people who get in his way.</p>

<p>"This is a battle for the fate of the nation!　I won't let it be used as an accessory to a joke of a married couple!</p>

<p>He flicked the scythe spear, which wavered with magic power, and dispelled the slash as he pulled it back with his sword spine. I was going to take one of his fingers, but there was no chance to take advantage of his honest spear handling.</p>

<p>“Disproportionate, I refuse to allow dishonest people to have unworthy skills.”</p>

<p>“You're not the same man who's all talk.”</p>

<p>“What, you want me so bad?”</p>

<p>Deborah backs away from his ardent confession and asks with a wistful look in her eyes.</p>

<p>“It's not fashionable to be in love with someone from the side.”</p>

<p>I don't want a wife who invites a man's predilection. Yogim gently nails it. What he lacks now is deep love. The power of love is always great.</p>

<p>"Shhhh, you lascivious bastards!　I'll show you my guts!"</p>

<p>Sylance's eyes were bloodshot and her throat was ripping as she howled in rage. The vice-commander of the Knights of Reharzen and his squires were the highest obstacle in the couple's life.</p>

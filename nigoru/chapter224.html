<p>Episode 69</p>

<p>The muddy waters of the monster known as the Great Outbreak have drastically rewritten the power structure of the northern countries. The Kingdom of Craist, which had greatly expanded its territory during the last war, had acquired people and lands that would become the foundation of the nation, but it also faced many problems. A feast that is not commensurate with the national power can lead to indigestion. One of the distortions that accompanied such territorial expansion was the provisional border with the Duchy of Myard.</p>

<p>The land, which continued to expand without limit, reached the Duchy of Myard, exposing a flaw. Many of the existing forts and cities that had been in place for decades or even centuries would have been excellent if evaluated as stand-alone defensive facilities. However, all of them were located in the interior of the old country and were inadequate for external preparedness, no matter how they were dressed up. Distance and location sometimes render good fortifications useless. It was a natural consequence of this that unnecessary forts were torn down and fortifications were built on the provisional border.</p>

<p>However, even if the transportation routes to the provisional border line, the front line, had been built in a haphazard manner, the villages that served as relay bases would have perished in the Great Outbreak, along with their foundations. Populated areas that produce goods and feed the army were left empty. In a country that is heavily weighted toward the military, even the civilian officials, who are few in number, are further tormented by labor. They stared at the map, tried to find a suitable location, and traveled around the area, wondering whether it was feasible with the country's limited resources. After all these hardships, they moved forward with settlements in transit areas and hastened the construction of fortresses on the provisional border areas.</p>

<p>They had some success. Otherwise, a surprise attack on Myard would never have taken place. According to the civilian officials who were engaged in the work, they had made it look like they had made it in time. That is the only word that comes to mind. Even with two years of preparation, there was no way that the construction of a fortress to control the entire border with Myard could be accomplished.</p>

<p>Mountain and hill castles that utilized natural strategic points were given up because of the difficulty of construction and the preparation period. After a series of compromises, a flat castle with some elevation differences was built. The attached defensive facilities were single earthworks with little vertical depth, the result of prioritizing the temporary accommodation of a large military force.</p>

<p>The various elements that make up the fortress are the same as those of the earthen mound. The main building has a drafty atmosphere, the granary is noticeably empty, and the barracks are inadequate for the number of people it can accommodate. The castle was suitable for a foothold from which a large army could set out, but it was a difficult castle to stay in. It may sound good to say that it was a provisional border line with multiple forts functionally systematized around a flat castle, but the key castle was in this condition. The forts scattered around the perimeter were in a state of dismal condition.</p>

<p>The Knights of Reharzen, who had been defeated from the Celta Peninsula after the half destruction of the field army, were forced to face this miserable reality. Seen from afar, the situation was a veritable comedy of confusion. After some twists and turns, they came to understand the current situation and dispersed their main forces to the rear of the provisional border line, which they were to hold. It was not because of any strategic advantage. They simply had no choice but to do so.</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Craist's army, which had a population and land that exceeded the country's strength due to the unexpected fortune of the Great Outbreak, did not have the resources to support its soldiers for a long period of time. The remote location of the enemy's territory and the meager supply lines were built on the premise of short-term battles and looting. The contents of the granaries, where not even rats could gather, were mostly scattered when the army was defeated. The concentrated operation of a corps burdened with logistics was already an unrealized dream.</p>

<p>"We don't have enough. Everything is missing."</p>

<p>Johanna did not even notice the words that leaked out unconsciously. He asked himself questions on the map spread out in a messy manner and exchanged words with the military and civilian officials who came to report on the situation. There was already no talk of an offensive, and all they could talk about was how to maintain the status quo. The only thing to do is to keep the troops in the cities and farming villages that could become supply areas for food and fodder, and if Myard launches a counterattack, to gather troops from all over the country to counterattack.</p>

<p>"The transportation of provisions and fodder to Salo has been delayed. This is partly due to the loss of some of the carts and wagons, but also because the soldiers who have left the corps have turned to banditry."</p>

<p>"A militia group that was supposed to be deployed to Fort Bünker is in the square. They seem to have wandered in."</p>

<p>Johanna swallowed the anger that rose to her throat. A blunder unthinkable in peacetime is being repeated. If there are not enough generals, the troops lose control, and if there are not enough officers, the troops turn into a ragtag mob. Even the squires and retinues that are the hands and feet of the knightly order have been wiped out. There was no way to find additional personnel, and the Knights of Reharzen were forced to deal with the situation on a case-by-case basis by diluting personnel in the name of "field appointees. Changing titles does not necessarily change their abilities, though.</p>

<p>"...... apply several old squires to the hunt for field officers. If they do a good job, they may even be able to get the vacant knight's position.</p>

<p>Squires who have been passed over due to lack of skill or lack of equipment are eagerly awaiting the opportunity to become knights. Many of them lack individual fighting skills and command abilities, but they are as good as regular knights if you look at only some of their advantages.</p>

<p>"The sun will set in a few hours, give the ...... militia a diluted barley gruel and urge them to go to Bünker in the early morning. I will send a letter to the senior knight, Lord Olof, who is encamped in Bünker, with a description of the situation."</p>

<p>“Johanna, I think you are being too lenient with your soldiers.”</p>

<p>"In peacetime, this would be unacceptable, but these are times of war. I don't need to tell you what will happen if you send them out at night under these circumstances."</p>

<p>Exhausted morale and darkness. How many soldiers would disappear into the night before they reached the site? Even a crude barley gruel made from water with a little flavor and slime would be enough to fill their bellies. If they rest their legs and heads for a night, fewer will desert their ranks.</p>

<p>“...... Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>The reply was brusque. The knight was not completely convinced by the generous instructions, but he did understand them to a certain extent. Johanna, who had taken the measure with a hint of calculation due to the time of war, received a report that she could not overlook.</p>

<p>"The lord of Raimat protested that the soldiers had committed violence against the citizens.</p>

<p>What exactly did they do?</p>

<p>“It appears to be theft and assault.”</p>

<p>...... flog as many of them as they stole and assaulted.</p>

<p>Some of you may be too numerous..."</p>

<p>Johanna fully understood what the knight was trying to say.</p>

<p>"If you endure your sins, I will forgive you. If you cannot endure, then ...... expose what remains."</p>

<p>“In the center of the city?”</p>

<p>It was an appropriate place to vent to the affected citizens and lords. But Johanna saw other uses for it.</p>

<p>“No, use it as a traffic route to Bünker.”</p>

<p>The corpses of one's own kind are instinctively repellent. It was a technique used to warn against intelligent demons and vermin. This time, however, it was for an untrustworthy militia group.</p>

<p>"They cling to vile methods that cannot be called 'tricks. Is this no different from the imperial soldiers? I am sure Commander Gran will be laughing in the netherworld."</p>

<p>In peacetime, she was a female knight who was known for her honest personality and ability to take care of the younger generation, but the battlefield transforms people. Johanna's face lost all flexibility and became hard as a rock.</p>

<p>Under the order of Deputy Commander Lash, the most senior knight, the Royal Army avoided fatal wounds by retreating swiftly and outstripping the pursuing attack. The problem was that they had abandoned many supplies in enemy territory. Rationing was slow, and starving soldiers frequently looted their own territory. Security deteriorated sharply, and the morale of the soldiers declined significantly. The situation is not going to stop, but is instead going to escalate.</p>

<p>"We are short a unit of the militia we ordered to assemble in Raimat.</p>

<p>“Did they fall behind during the retreat?”</p>

<p>"No, it's a hundred men. Perhaps..."</p>

<p>Johanna understood what had happened.</p>

<p>“Organized rebellion?”</p>

<p>The unwillingness to desert gave rise to bandits called deserters. The thieves are still cute enough to flee at once as soon as they have achieved their goal of looting the city. The problem lay with those who did not flee. The ruined Kingdom of Felius was a powerful nation in the northern countries, along with the Liberitoa Trade Federation. Even though it lost its framework as a nation, the pride that resided within it was strong and powerful.</p>

<p>Feudalism and communal obligations no longer apply to them. They have lost the family and the village, and have lost their common obligations. They have no assets to stop and hold them together. The standing army, which had played a blackmailing role, was half destroyed, and the loss of the knightly class of officers was especially fatal. Thus, the commanders of the former Ferius' army, the fringe of the nobility, revealed their hidden ambitions.</p>

<p>“As I recall, we have lost contact with some of the forts and villages near the provisional border.”</p>

<p>“They may be trying to sell themselves at a higher price with their souvenirs.”</p>

<p>A misunderstanding caused by the confusion during the retreat. There were no optimists left to cling to such wishful thinking.</p>

<p>“He made the most of his position in the interregnum,” he said.</p>

<p>What about sending troops to search and suppress?</p>

<p>"For now, endure. The luxury of moving troops is gone from our side."</p>

<p>It's easy to order a defected unit to be crushed - if you don't consider the risk. The priority is to put out the fire. Lars, the most senior knight, reminded me of this. If he made a bad move and suffered further burns, not only his remaining fingers, but also his arm could become necrotic. At any rate, the tangled chain of command must now be untangled, and the corps must be reorganized into the optimum form.</p>

<p>In order to get ahead of the Liberitoa Trade Federation, Craist was in a quagmire because he was thinking about the big picture. The curse of hegemony and a longing akin to jealousy toward the three major powers led him down the wrong path. He was led astray by his own jealousy of the three great powers. A gloomy atmosphere swirled in the command center. As if to blow away such sedimented mud, the door was opened.</p>

<p>"Yo, Johanna-sama, urgent news!</p>

<p>A call of urgency. But in this place, the words were already commonplace. I interrupted my thoughts and imagined the contents of the urgent message. More rebellions, or the advance of the Duchy of Myard's troops from the provisional border line?</p>

<p>"Calm down. What happened?"</p>

<p>As the soldiers recounted the details, the command center, which had been so noisy, was quiet. Everyone stopped their work and chewed over the words with great effort. Even Johanna was no exception.</p>

<p>“A huge shadow in Lake Celta, a red light rising from the bottom of the water...”</p>

<p>The carcass of the lake dragon that was eaten to pieces, the red flame that burns even the water, the unreasonableness like a natural disaster that twists reason. Johanna was convinced. Still, he could not be certain that there was no mistake. No, the situation in the country would not allow it.</p>

<p>"It is forbidden to speak out to all who have witnessed or know of the situation. No exceptions. If you break it, you will lose your head. You have my strict orders."</p>

<p>Johanna ran her eyes and put pressure on everyone gathered in the command center.</p>

<p>"Send the deputy commander Lash of Salo and his fast horse to the royal capital. We must inform His Majesty the King as soon as possible."</p>

<p>Death was sleeping right at his feet. Was he foolishly waging war in such a place? Johanna wanted to laugh in her swirling emptiness. But his position and personality would not allow it.</p>

<p>"We will strengthen the surveillance of the lakeshore. Ostensibly to warn Myard's navy..."</p>

<p>I fight my emotions with strength in my belly. Losing a leader to rely on, Johanna scratches at the seaweed as hard as she can. That's why she missed it. She gave away information. To the one girl she should have protected.</p>

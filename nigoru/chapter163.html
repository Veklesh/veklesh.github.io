<p>Episode 10</p>

<p>The taste of clods and blood in my mouth, the searing heat waves burning my skin. Perhaps it was the impact, but I couldn't think clearly, as if a haze had settled over my head. In the sky, the thin clouds were tinged with red, catching the afterglow of the setting sun. On the ground, the blue sun was lighting up the surroundings as if it were eroding the sunset.</p>

<p>"Uh-oh, it won't go away. It won't go away!</p>

<p>“Stop moving, oh oh oh!”</p>

<p>“Don't cut each other in the front, take the flanks!”</p>

<p>People were burning like bonfires. What was once a brother transformed into something else and turned on the soldiers. The body is cut off, armor and all, and the head that touched the hammer dissipates into the void. The scattered pieces of flesh are also entangled in the Demon Fire, burning to ashes. Hayes, who had been sitting there, unable to grasp the reality of the situation, is suddenly shaken and realizes that a soldier is calling out to him.</p>

<p>"Fit my shoulder. Hey, you hear me, Hayes!"</p>

<p>It was Howard, a friend of the war. The Liberitoa soldier who rescued Hayes at the border section repeatedly shouts his name with his left shoulder slouched down.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I can hear you.”</p>

<p>The blurred focus returned, and Hayes' consciousness finally returned to reality.</p>

<p>“Muscle and bone,” he said.</p>

<p>"The fingers are moving. Maybe it's not cut."</p>

<p>The armor had been ripped off with such force that he didn't even bother to take it off. Hayes reached out and began palpating. When he ran his hand along the base of the shoulder, there was no bone where it should be, and when he pressed, his fingers dug in. Under the skin was a void. A search of the surrounding area revealed that the bony head of the upper arm had moved forward, perhaps to the front. Perhaps it had been dislocated by that alien ogre.</p>

<p>“Stay relaxed.”</p>

<p>Placing my right hand on the shoulder blade, I grab the upper arm with my left hand and push it in while rolling it inward. An exhale leaks out due to the pain. After the jostling response, Hayes looks down to the treatment area and notices his comrade-in-arms turn to explore the freshly hooked shoulder and clutch his sword.</p>

<p>“Get up, Hayes, you're going to get wiped out if you keep this up.”</p>

<p>Hayes understood what the words meant. There were thirty soldiers and only a dozen or so left, and they too would be buried in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>“You think I can stop that thing?”</p>

<p>Through countless deaths, Hayes has indeed been trained. Otherwise, a wandering Highserk would not have served as a company commander in the Liberitoa Trade Federation Federation. But facing that thing head-on was a joke of poor quality. The sticky blue flames were about to burn everything in the vicinity to ashes. Even in melee combat, the ten-man force was being pushed back against the giant ogre. What could he do with his puny body? It was an excessive expectation.</p>

<p>"And you want me to kill my brother again. Twice."</p>

<p>He may have changed his appearance, but he was still my brother. As I turned my thoughts to that point, the fearful sensation of the sword I had thrust at him returned and my hand trembled. Howard, frustration on his face, sat down with a thud right next to Hayes.</p>

<p>"I'm a soldier hired by the state for money. When I was a brat with no education and no lore, this seemed like the best path for me. Actually, it wasn't. The battlefield is nothing but a bonus. Both friend and foe die without accomplishment and without a moment's thought. Among those we killed, there were even soldiers who looked like brats. Now that I think about it, they were probably fighting for money, land, duty, or something inevitable in their own way, just like us."</p>

<p>As the battle with the female ogre continues, the two adults stand side by side, exchanging words. It was a very leisurely and out-of-place exchange. Still, Hayes continued to listen.</p>

<p>"...... have you heard the rumors of the Great Outbreak? I'm sure there was some kind of gag order issued to the troops who had retreated from the Ferius area, but you can't put words in people's mouths. One of the rumors flying around was that they intentionally caused the Great Outbreak by burning down the Great Satanic Domain in the center of the continent in order to break the war. It may be a common eyebrow-raising story on the battlefield. Still, this is a classy homeland that uses its brother as live bait to kill powerful enemy soldiers. It could be possible."</p>

<p>The story was unknown to Hayes, a former Highserk. Perhaps it had little credibility, or perhaps it had not been passed on for fear of animosity or sedition. It was the abominable cause of the loss of his family and homeland and the collapse of his country, but he could not connect it with the current situation.</p>

<p>“Howard, what's your point?”</p>

<p>Hayes asked directly, seeking certainty.</p>

<p>"There is no righteousness to be served in a frivolous country. It's this mayhem. We've got our hands full with surveillance, and if one of them gets away, it won't go undetected. Even the bodies look like that. There's not even a bone left in the ground. ......Forget your brother, take your family and run away to another country. Well, it's not as easy as it sounds. Leaving the land is hard. You know that. After all, this is how people kill each other over land. If I can't convince you to leave, leave your family some money and go alone. It's going to be a long rest of your life."</p>

<p>The words of the Liberitoa, who had known him for a long time, were hard to believe.</p>

<p>“What about you?”</p>

<p>"I won't be worth what I'm hired for. Still, I'm a soldier and a Liberitoa. I'm a little patriotic, a little proud. And I can't leave those guys behind. I'll stay. ...... Hayes, don't make any silly sympathies or misunderstandings. I'm the kind of guy who thinks a deliberate Great Outbreak makes sense if it weakens a hostile nation across Lake Celta."</p>

<p>In response to Howard's honest outburst, Hayes turns his thoughts hard. Not much time either way.</p>

<p>"To be honest, I was hoping they'd just burn it down. Me, too, all of it. But yeah. At least I made my choice while I had a choice. So did my brother. No matter what I say, in the end, all I've done is put my sword to the plot. I don't blame man or country. I abandoned Walm."</p>

<p>"Are you serious?　He could be your brother, even in that way."</p>

<p>“He's my brother, and I'm not going to kill him once and then say it was a mistake - now I'm not sure which of the two brothers is going to the Underworld.”</p>

<p>Hayes killed his brother and chose a military career in Liberitoa. A fearless and bloody path. And yet he chose it. He must fulfill his responsibility. Determined, Hayes kneads his magical power and manifests his skills. Unlike Demon Fire, which burns all things, Hayes' ability is, oddly enough, Freeze. The raging heat wave and the cold air fought each other. The difference between the two was striking. The cold air was consumed by the blue flames, and the magical membrane was shaken by the heat.</p>

<p>Hayes squinted at the heat and his gaze crossed with a female ogre. The golden eyes of the female ogre were focused on her prey. The white vapor is exhaled from the mouth along with the cold air, and a crackling sound is made as a blade of ice is formed. The ice sword and the hammer from the lower level intersect with each other, interrupting their friend's attack.</p>

<p>After a momentary struggle, the ice sword was broken in front of the “hard blow” and the blue flame. Countless pieces of ice scattered like hailstones in the void. Without even saying a word, the demon hammers away, as if to say, "You're not what I expected. There is no mistaking that assessment. Hayes has neither the “Vajra,” which transforms his body into steel, nor the “hard-hitting,” which turns the dullest of scrap metal into a work of art, nor the skill to bury his enemies by the squadron. They are just things that we have grasped through our own bad luck, drowned in the muddy waters of the Great Outbreak. Even so, he was used to doing bad footwork.</p>

<p>With his left hand as the nucleus, he cloaked himself in ice in disorder and intercepted the hammer. The ice shield was shattered with a high-pitched scream that sounded as if many pieces of glass were shattered. The ogre turns his wrist as if he were cleaving a troublesome weed and tries to cleave Haze's torso with the remaining ice, but his gaze catches Haze's right hand and slides to the ice that had been spreading.</p>

<p>“Chi.”</p>

<p>Haze was caught off guard and withdrew his hand. The shattered remnants of the ice sword knotted in the void, changing its shape. The ice blade that raised its sickle aims for his neck, but is deflected by the hammerhead.</p>

<p>“Too bad.”</p>

<p>Haze throws down the scythe and re-forms the ice sword, but the female ogre's form is scratched away. Sinking down its body and accelerated by the hot air, the hulking body leaps into the air with the speed of an arrow. The difference in their physical strength has already been proven by the martyrs.</p>

<p>Hayes jumped backward, but he could not avoid it completely. Even a blistering blow out of time would send a shock through the ice that clings to his body. He swallows the air and curses that are about to leak out, thrusts the ice sword in place of a staff into the ground, and then takes control. Without a moment's rest, a barrage of blows is about to be unleashed, but in the few moments of stalling, the remaining soldiers come up for air. Only a few of them were unharmed, but they were soldiers who had just been chosen by the burn-face's foreign minister, and their movements were swift.</p>

<p>"Leethia, don't aim too softly, keep shooting!</p>

<p>"I know, I know!</p>

<p>The mage soldiers, who were mainly long-range, were deliberately gobbled up by the initial white soldiers. The great female ogres are playful and cunning. We have to get them to work hard enough, whether they are men or women, which Hayes doesn't like. If it was a valuable magic bearer, it was even more so. The wind blade forces you to evade or intercept. If he made a mistake, Haze would be cut to pieces, but it was an inevitable risk.</p>

<p>He maintained a certain distance from the storm of iron and blue flame while using ice. If he carelessly approached too close, he would be crushed, and he might receive a misfire. On the other hand, if they moved away excessively, the female ogre with superior instantaneous force would turn its point of view to another friend of theirs.</p>

<p>"Don't jump in unnecessarily. Be creative with your distance!　Lefty, don't stop, or you'll be eaten."</p>

<p>Howard, back in the line of fire, gives instructions to Lefty, who is slow to move due to his crushed ribs. The people whose magic and concentration had been sapped by the Demon Fire have barely regained control. The cold air that Haze was wearing weakened the firepower of the blue flame, just as if he had thrown raw wood with excessive moisture into a bonfire.</p>

<p>“Huh, gghhhh.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the consumption of magic power to produce the cold air was tremendous, and the ice used for offense and defense melted and became easy to be shattered. The antagonistic state is only based on thin ice. Swords, spears, and shields were shot down countless times. The repeated re-formation of the ice causes a lack of magical power. Nausea and headaches are induced by the expiring magic.</p>

<p>There was no way that he could take into account his limbs, which were becoming dull and crippled. The melting ice is tinged with vermilion. While the hammers lashed out at the ice, two soldiers slipped in from either side. Howard slammed a longsword into the head and Lefty into the shin.</p>

<p>The great female ogre pulls back her outstretched arm. She folds her upper body, deflecting her chest, and pulls her legs in a scraping motion. Two blows are evaded as if scraping through. The shimmering blue flame dulls the sense of distance, but one of the underlying factors was the good eye.</p>

<p>“Is this still not good enough?”</p>

<p>Hayes squeezes what little magic he has and creates an ice tree from his feet. A thin branch, raped by the heat, was not fatal, but it could not be. The tree is cleaved away by a hammer clad in blue flame. As the fine ice diffuses with the light of the blue flame, it turns to the opposite side of the dominant hand that holds the hammer.</p>

<p>“Hmph!”</p>

<p>For the first time throughout the series of battles, the great ogre's movements are delayed. The dazzle had a certain effect. At this unique opportunity, Hayes steps in undaunted. A hastily constructed ice spear extends and catches the ogre in the head. What he gets is a laceration on the cheek and a streak of blood. A chill runs down Hayes' spine. He had been caught just in time for a blow from a blind spot. He regrets his mistake, as he should have aimed for the torso instead of the head, which is closer to the eyes, but the payoff was the fist that loomed in front of him. The blow, accompanied by the sound of the wind, shattered a person's skull.</p>

<p>There was no hope for complete evasion. Haze, slanted by the ice that clings to his body, can only cling to his body like a shell. The impact is like being run over by a horseman.</p>

<p>"Haze!</p>

<p>No longer recognizable as anyone's voice. His body floats into the void, rolling on the ground without knowing where to turn or which way to go. His breathing chokes as if he has swallowed mud, and his whole body complains of pain. I move my limbs to check the ground and finally regain my balance. His chest aches with each shallow breath. The enemy is not waiting for me. Hayes is about to return to the line of fire when the noisy sounds of battle have ceased. The hot wind had died down, and only the remaining fire illuminated the battlefield suspiciously.</p>

<p>“What are you--?”</p>

<p>Hayes, unable to swallow the situation, asks, but before he can ask, the situation is cleared up. The body of the great female ogre rippled on the surface, swaying irregularly like slime. Howard and his team were unable to keep their distance and attack. Now that the enemy's situation was unknown, they had no choice but to search for it by projecting magic from medium and long distances. Hayes tried to call out to Leethia, who was frozen like an ice statue, but was interrupted by the female ogre, who had remained silent.</p>

<p>“Leaked, huh, what a half-assed attempt.”</p>

<p>The female ogre blurted out in a choked tone, then inflated her 《Demon Fire》 again and blew out hot air. Blinded by the azure flames, the giant ogre scraped itself off into the forest shadows. It breathes irregularly and stares at its traces, but there is no further change. Much of the situation remains unclear, but one thing is certain: Hayes has picked up life.</p>

<p>“How many, how many are alive?”</p>

<p>One of the surviving soldiers muttered.</p>

<p>"Eight. The special platoon leader is burning around there and I don't know which one."</p>

<p>Howard, who had been searching around, replied. Of the special platoon, the commander was killed in action, and only eight men retained their human form. The rest were equally stinky and smoldering with blue flames.</p>

<p>"What about command? Howard, your predecessor?"</p>

<p>Lefty, protecting his ribs, begs for a decision. Aside from Hayes, a former adventurer who was a drifter and a newcomer, an old Highserk, Howard was the oldest of the surviving Liberitoa soldiers in the war.</p>

<p>“For a start,” he said, “I'd say ...... command, but in this state, we can only run back.”</p>

<p>It was already difficult to continue the mission. The mission had failed in the worst possible way, and I could now picture the look of displeasure on the Foreign Minister's face.</p>

<p>“Hayes, your brother or sister-”</p>

<p>“...... don't know, I don't have a sister like that.”</p>

<p>A soldier with burns asks Hayes. I had brothers, but a big, stupid, bloodthirsty sister like that, no joke.</p>

<p>"What about the bodies? There is no way to identify them."</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence at Leethia's words, and Howard opened his grave mouth.</p>

<p>"If it's still alive, pick up a head of hair, if not, pick up a ring or portable equipment to replace the remains. This is a big mess. Highserk's border guards are coming running in. We're leaving now."</p>

<p>After collecting the relics in sight, the group leaves the village, leaving the bodies behind. After being hit twice by 《Demon Fire》, their hometown is completely reduced to ashes. Haze looks out over the forest where the female ogre has disappeared. It is the same forest where he and his three brothers used to run around when he was a child. The second brother is dead, and the remaining three have gone the wrong way. Hopefully, the brothers will not be reunited in this life.</p>

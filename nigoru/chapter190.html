<p>Episode 37</p>

<p>“Lord Walm, you're alive and well!”</p>

<p>"The road was tough, but I made it. Justan, come here. It's Moritz.</p>

<p>"Thank you for coming. How's the war going?</p>

<p>"Not so good, since they have taken the initiative by surprise and first strike. Craist's army has reached the outer perimeter of the Zerebeth Mountains, and all communication lines to the outside world have been cut off, except for the waterway.</p>

<p>Fragments of conversations streaming in from across the wall clearly announce that the war between the countries has begun once again. Ayane could not get a sense of reality, even though she was one of the parties involved. It felt as if it were irrelevant information echoing from the radio.</p>

<p>“It was a close call, wasn't it?”</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right. Except for Cape Gara, where Lord Friug's company is retreating, the Six Mouths of Zelebes are completely blocked."</p>

<p>“If we had been a little later, we would have been entangled in the blockade.”</p>

<p>Ayane was in an extremely tense state while crossing the enemy territory, slipping through the surveillance net like crossing thin ice. She was so busy supporting and following along that she had no time to think about what was ahead. That all changed when she stepped onto the ground in Celta and literally drew a breath. For Ayane now, leisure time was a deadly poison. She is trapped in a cul-de-sac of thoughts, and is trapped in memories of the past like a bottomless swamp. Small choices, casual conversations, and the passing of time, which she regrets over and over again, even though they are not covered by the past.</p>

<p>Even the happy memories seem distorted. How much better it would have been if it had been a dream. The unadulterated murderous intent directed at my best friend in the mining town and the horrific battle at Fort Esquiche were undeniably real, and the pain that consumed my heart was real.</p>

<p>“It's still real, after all.”</p>

<p>Back in Celta, the worst imaginings turned into certainties. All-out war was already inevitable. No, the edges of war were already opening everywhere. What to do, heal people again? And then again in the next war. There was no end in sight. Naturally, my eyes were closed, and there was no way I could look ahead.</p>

<p>Ayane bites her tongue, and a shadow appears over her. She looked up and saw Maia, with whom she had spent many days. She sat down and clutched her knees, then locked gazes with the healer, who remained seated.</p>

<p>“Do you regret what happened to Makoto-sama, or that the war has started?”</p>

<p>“...... neither.”</p>

<p>Like tangled threads, the two evil events shake Ayane's heart, even her beliefs, and entangle her deep in her roots.</p>

<p>“It was hard for me to accept the murderous acts of Makoto, with whom I had slept and eaten, and the outrages of my homeland,...... and to be honest, I still haven't completely swallowed it all.”</p>

<p>For Ayane, the Kingdom of Craist was a place of protection and a place to remember after wandering into another world. It was a place that she would never forget. Then I realized something. Maia, a Craist Kingdom native, had more attachment to and value for her homeland than they did.</p>

<p>“You know, ...... Maia, you know...”</p>

<p>He was foolishly occupied with himself. Would he repeat it again like he did with Makoto? Maia smiles gently at Ayane, who is at a loss for words. Then she changed her tone and spoke to him.</p>

<p>"This may sound cheesy. But I think of you like a sister."</p>

<p>“...... Eh, ah?”</p>

<p>Maia, who had returned her tone to the healer-magician, who remained frozen at the sudden confession, continued speaking.</p>

<p>"It is an old story, but I was a war orphan with no family. While growing up in a church orphanage, my aptitude for magic was recognized and I became an assistant healing sorcerer in the Royal Army of Craist. It was the only way to survive."</p>

<p>Ayane's head is in turmoil, but she still listens, not wanting to miss a single word.</p>

<p>"I didn't have the noble intention of wanting to help people or be useful. My life was colorless and tasteless, living as I was told. Even when I was assigned to be Ayane's assistant - but while I was spending time with you in Craist and Myard, I wondered if I had a family, if I had a sister, if this is what it would be like. Huh, even though I never had a sister. ...... For me, Ayane is someone I want to live with. I don't know what is right. Still, we have to live our lives to the best of our ability, lost and struggling. So let's do our best to live."</p>

<p>Her eyes, pointed straight at me, are simply warm. The shivering anxiety and loneliness fade away.</p>

<p>“......Yes.”</p>

<p>The meaning and emotion in this short response speaks eloquently. Maia's lips part, and she looks beyond the open door and lets the words slip out.</p>

<p>“The person who was snooping over there, right?”</p>

<p>An unexpected surprise. It was an imperial knight of a hundred battles who rushed away from the half-opened door. Ayane's mouth corners relax as she is caught by the flailing movement that is a far cry from her usual dependable appearance.</p>

<p>“Hmmm, yes.”</p>

<p>Her mood is still heavy and she remains anxious and fearful for tomorrow. Still, I'm ready to groping my way through the darkness.</p>

<p>“Walm, sir.”</p>

<p>“...... what's wrong?”</p>

<p>The imperial knight is trying to appear calm, but his voice is slightly higher in tone than usual. It was probably a habit of his to deceive. I had noticed this in my days with Walm. He is painfully good at disguising and killing himself. Ayane looked into his eyes, as Maia had done for me, and declared.</p>

<p>"There are many things that are hard for me. Still, I don't want to give up. Let's live in this world to the fullest. I'll do my best to live again, too!</p>

<p>“Yes, you're right. ...... I'll do my best to live through it, too.”</p>

<p>Walm smiled at me, awkwardly, but still. Ayane felt somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>“I'll have to get into the frontline treatment center and heal the injured as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>Many of the soldiers and people who had fled the temporary border area had been injured. Some are still wounded in the retreat at Cape Gara. Some will die while being brought to the treatment center in the military port city of Anxio. Ayane was prepared to follow her request and take up her post at the frontline field clinic.</p>

<p>“Ayane-sama, Maia-sama, we are out of the mosquito net?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, it's very disappointing.”</p>

<p>"You guys ...... let go. Stop, don't push your way into the narrow door.</p>

<p>It was Moritz, the escort and liaison officer, including Justin, who grumbled like a pariah. They were struggling to push the imperial knight out of Ayane's sight.</p>

<p>“Hmmm............I really don't want anyone to die, do you?”</p>

<p>Ayane revealed her true feelings mixed with laughter so as not to be noticed. It would be easy to give up or break down when crushed by an unwanted reality. Sometimes we may even give in and crumble. Still, one must continue to resist as long as one lives. With determination in her heart, Ayane began to move forward again. Wishing for the lives of her neighbors from the bottom of her heart.</p>

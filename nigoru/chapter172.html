<p>Episode 19</p>

<p>The incense that had been lingering inside the room fizzled out through the open armored door. The girl slowly inhaled the incoming outside air. No one likes the peculiar pungent smell of blood and pus mixed with the incense used in large-scale treatment. Ayane exhaled and looked back at the small call.</p>

<p>“I didn't see that many patients visiting today, did you?”</p>

<p>Maia finishes cleaning the medical instruments in the washroom and puts them back on the shelf. She is entrusted with incising wounds and removing foreign objects, and she has a penchant for tools and taking care of their storage.</p>

<p>“I wish days like this could go on and on - oh, I'm not trying to make it easy for you.”</p>

<p>The dependable treatment assistant smiles at Ayane, who hurriedly rephrases her words.</p>

<p>"I know. Ayane is too self-sacrificing, so you should learn to be a little lazy."</p>

<p>“Even with this, I've been looking around the lake and walking around the city lately.”</p>

<p>Ayane's cheeks puffed up slightly as if she was sulking, but these things were unthinkable a long time ago. At that time, immediately after the Great Outbreak, Dandurg Castle and the military port city of Ancushio were filled with seriously injured people who had barely managed to escape. Priority was given to those with injuries and physical strength, and they were treated until they ran out of consciousness and magical power. It must have been about two months. He spent his life packed in the church hall, never stepping outside. I would be lying if I said that I was not in any pain at all at the time. Still, it was hard to remember the Great Outbreak and the Imperial Knight who had died, so I was able to devote myself to my treatment.</p>

<p>Nearly two years have passed since the Great Outbreak, and things are changing. Walm, who was thought to have gone to the underworld, has returned to the northern countries. Ayane looked at the lake, exchanged words with people, and took time to sort out her feelings. It had been in vain, but it was a minor hassle if the promise was to be fulfilled.</p>

<p>“I'm glad to hear that.”</p>

<p>She smiled carefree at him. Ayane was in no way distressed. It is her own selfishness that binds her to Celta.</p>

<p>“Hey, after all, even if it's just Maia, she's still going to Craist...”</p>

<p>"No one forced me to stay. I made my own decision to stay here."</p>

<p>He sounded as if he were admonishing a little sister who had no clue what she was talking about. From afar, Craists and Liberitoa also come to the church to receive treatment. Among them was a messenger who had come through Maia to convey a request to return home. There were many opportunities to return to the Kingdom of Craist. Johanna and two of her childhood friends were there. Nowadays, the number of patients in need of treatment has decreased, and the promises made at Dandurg Castle have been fulfilled. In addition, there were people within the Duchy of Myard who wanted to repatriate her to the Kingdom of Craist in order to sell her debt to the Kingdom and deepen their relationship.</p>

<p>After much conflict, Ayane refused to be repatriated to Craist. This was partly because she wanted to spend time with the people gathered in the city, but the real reason was a concern that she has not revealed to anyone. In the past, when Ayane was sent to assassinate a man, Moritz, who was escorting her, told her that he was 'a military threat himself. In war, no one can remain irrelevant. Those words remain darkly in my mind to this day.</p>

<p>If Ayane and her childhood friend had not been in the allied camp, Craist might not have entered the war and the alliance might not have been formed. This is just a hypothetical story, and it may be a foolishly conceited overestimation. Even so, as a healing magician, I no longer had any intention of pretending that I had nothing to do with the war. With this resolve in mind, Ayane made the decision to remain in Myard as a deterrent to prevent war from happening.</p>

<p>“Thank you Maia .......”</p>

<p>Ayane spent a lot of time with Maia, both as a healing magician and as an individual. That is what she is saying. It would be impossible to persuade her. The only thing Ayane could do was to thank him sincerely.</p>

<p>“It's okay.”</p>

<p>She is still standing by me like this, putting even her country second. Ayane was filled with warmth and embarrassment. She hesitated to talk about something else, but then the door of the treatment center was discreetly slammed. There was a discreet tap on the door of the treatment center.</p>

<p>“Ayane-sama, Maia-sama, may I have a word?”</p>

<p>The voice came from a soldier who was acting as a guard. Ayane nodded as they looked at each other. There must have been an emergency brought in.</p>

<p>"I'm fine. Are you injured?"</p>

<p>Maia asks on behalf of the two.</p>

<p>“It seems that the head instructor Deborah and one soldier were injured during training - the soldier seems to be a friend of yours.”</p>

<p>A brusque way of putting it. Injuries during training were common, but what didn't add up was that Deborah, the instructor, had been injured. If he knew her, there was only one thing he could think of.</p>

<p>Is this Mr. Walm?</p>

<p>Yes, I'm Chief Protector Walm.</p>

<p>What is he doing?</p>

<p>He came to Ancushio to heal his eye, but he is now getting more injuries. Maia let out a sigh.</p>

<p>“First of all, let's see the extent of his injuries.”</p>

<p>Ayane guessed from the soldier's calm appearance that it was not life-threatening. The chief guard and the head instructor entered through the open door. Usually, these two men have an air of dependability beyond their stature, but right now they are as quiet as a borrowed cat. Before palpating them in detail, Ayane, as a healing magician, found out what had happened.</p>

<p>“It's a blow mark and a tightening mark, isn't it?”</p>

<p>Maia's gaze was as cold as ice as she spoke for me.</p>

<p>"Let's see, that means they hit each other and fought. Without even adding or subtracting in training?"</p>

<p>“...... that's right.”</p>

<p>“I'm sorry about that.”</p>

<p>The two confessed that they could not escape the pursuit.</p>

<p>"What, what are you doing!　This is not a children's fight!"</p>

<p>When they raised their voices in anger, which they usually do not reveal, the accompanying soldiers outside fearfully looked into their faces. Among them was even Friug, the master of the infantry company that had been increased.</p>

<p>"A broken nose, blunt trauma to the side, and a sprained neck. This one has a swollen fist, an oral laceration, and an incomplete dislocation of a tooth?"</p>

<p>Maia probes the area of pain and announces her diagnosis. What could two people who are so skillfully clad in magical membranes do to cause so much physical pain in training? Ayane wanted to hold her head in her hands.</p>

<p>“Even if they are two people who are putting together people, even if it's just a training-type clandestine team, it's still bloody....”</p>

<p>Maia's sermon begins as she applies medical treatment. Ayane completely agreed. Halfway through the lecture, the sound of running echoes down the corridor. A charming face peeked out at Moritz, who is a liaison officer under Brigadier Justus.</p>

<p>"I heard you, Mister Walm. I heard that you won the hand-to-hand combat with Deborah!　Well, I wish I could have seen it. I heard that she choked him with her foot in a spectacular manner. The soldiers celebrated with the sake they got. I just remembered something urgent."</p>

<p>Moritz, who was wound up with a look of excitement, understands belatedly the devastation in the room, turns on his heel and runs away from the church hall. It was as if he was fleeing before the enemy.</p>

<p>“I don't think so, but is that the spoils of war?”</p>

<p>Maia asks Friug in disapproval, and he assures her without hiding the items he carries under his arm.</p>

<p>“This is my share for the chief guardian and the chief instructor.”</p>

<p>“This is why Myard and Highserk are .......”</p>

<p>Contrary to Maia, who spat out, Walm, a knight of the empire, said with a tremor in his voice.</p>

<p>"In the spoils of war, yes, there are good pastries. I'd like Ayane and Maia to try it."</p>

<p>Silence pervades the room. A bitter excuse from a soldier who has been through so many ordeals.</p>

<p>“...... Ayane, this is the bribe.”</p>

<p>"Mr. Walm, please sit there. It's going to be a long story."</p>

<p>"The Luring Fire of the Underworld. The knight seems to love playing with fire as his name implies. Ayane and Walm, fueled by anger, scolded Ayane and Walm together. There was no sign of the “Demon Fire,” a fearsome weapon of the Highserk Empire's greatest strength.</p>

<p>The church hall was filled with the noise of the people. Ironically, this was proof of peace. Seven days after the commotion that began with the hand-to-hand combat, a massive landslide occurred at the Refun mine, which the Duchy of Myard had annexed. Ayane was sent to the site to treat the seriously injured who were unable to move.</p>

<p>Episode 50</p>

<p>The hill had always been cramped with two armies trying to raise their own banner in the land of Orserica. Now the hill was deserted, even including the cut and flat areas. Those who stand on the battlefield are sparse, and the byproducts of the struggle lie everywhere. Walm, walking through the gaps between the corpses, called out to the soldiers.</p>

<p>"Move as soon as you take a breath. I want to throw out my limbs, too, but I haven't won yet. Ask your superiors for instructions."</p>

<p>The lethargic exhaustion after the affair, or what one might call the intoxication of warm blood, had cooled off. They stand dumbfounded, take off their helmets and sit on the ground. If this were a battle that had been won, they could have enjoyed their leisure to the fullest, but they had just bounced off the enemy at one of the six mouths of Zerebeth, and that too in the vanguard position.</p>

<p>"Ugh?　Ah, ah, Lord Protector. I apologize. I lost my strength."</p>

<p>“Let's go, Gaston.”</p>

<p>With trailing steps, they headed for Moyes, who was in charge of the left wing. Surrounded by several men who repeatedly reported back to him, he issued a notice to treat the wounded and to be on the lookout for earthworks.</p>

<p>“......You've made it through the mountainous terrain.”</p>

<p>The way he rallied the remaining soldiers, even as he wiped the blood from his hands, was truly encouraging. The luxury of rejoicing in the growth of the younger generation and thinking about it alone is not available to the current imperial knights.</p>

<p>“Mr. Walm, this way!”</p>

<p>“Yogim, you look well.”</p>

<p>Walm walked alongside the beckoning and calling. With a soft tone that was not appropriate for the occasion, he mixed in some small talk and crossed the plain that had been turned into a graveyard.</p>

<p>"Ha, I thought I was going to die many times. It's been a long time since I danced on the death line with my wife."</p>

<p>Despite his weary appearance and weak voice, only his eyes glaze over with excitement. The imperial knight was impressed by the fact that his wife was his wife and her husband was her husband. If that's the case, the couple must be getting along well.</p>

<p>“I'm glad to see you're so hot ......, so how many survivors are left?”</p>

<p>"The remaining soldiers, including the wounded, are one and a half platoons. Even if we regrouped, we'd still be good for two platoons."</p>

<p>The garrison, which had been depleted and then augmented, was not large enough to be an augmented company, but its sufficiency rate was still more than enough for a full formation. Walm, biting back a sigh and a curse, proceeded to check the current situation.</p>

<p>“Have we been reduced to that?”</p>

<p>“Even if we defend the earthworks with all our men, the front line will be eaten through with a single thrust, won't it?”</p>

<p>"Abandonment is appropriate. The rear will not be ordered to hold firm if the company is decimated with every reinforcement."</p>

<p>The order to defend the company was not given. On Orzerica Hill, retreat is permitted at the discretion of the local commander. The reason they had to fight so thoroughly was because of the enemy's onslaught, which did not allow for a regular retreat.</p>

<p>It's a wonder there hasn't been a second attack without a hair's breadth."</p>

<p>"That's what I've always feared. I'm still horrified by it and can't stand it."</p>

<p>If you are willing to pay attention to wear and tear, a wave attack by an attacker who outnumbers you is an extremely effective means of attack. The imperial knights were not anxious about when the company of paratroopers, which was busy sending back the wounded, would be attacked.</p>

<p>“I guess we'll just have to keep up appearances and prepare to retreat while keeping our wits about us.”</p>

<p>“I really don't think I should be a commander.”</p>

<p>The blood flowing from the mouth cut by the battle is really bitter. There is a limit to how much you can do with the limited cards in your hand. The proof of his guilt was spreading at his feet. The eyes of the dead, now empty, glared bitterly at the imperial knight. But he never turned away from them because of his duty and regret for those who fought and died.</p>

<p>"......You're absolutely right. By the way, it looks like the Yarkuk soldiers took the old general's corpse with them after the general collapse."</p>

<p>“It would have been troublesome if he had been crushed in that manner.”</p>

<p>The momentum would have been different if they had been dead soldiers, Yarkuk soldiers who believed in Ratu. If that had happened, the imperial knights would have had to drown Orzerica Saka in blue flames, regardless of whether they were friend or foe. Only Demon Mask would regret that they were indigestion and raw killings.</p>

<p>“I guess they must have believed in you as a person as well, retreating with a corpse from the midst of the enemy.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess the commander over here didn't.”</p>

<p>"Don't be so gullible, you two. You're going to kill our guest."</p>

<p>The man she was looking for was at Deborah's feet, arms folded in exasperation. The man's body, lying helplessly, was a wretched sight. His armor, stripped of all clasps, was covered with countless internal bleeding and lacerations. His limbs were either smashed or crushed, and half of his face had been gouged out. Still, a slightly swollen chest announces a fragile survival.</p>

<p>"You're a big man. You're Sylance, deputy commander of the Knights of Reharzen. I'd like to take him prisoner."</p>

<p>"Impossible. I've gone too far with the showmanship. And I'm too gaunt."</p>

<p>Deborah poked at a number of vials with the tip of her shoe. Many of the vials were empty, but liquid remained in the broken ones. The smell of chemicals, reminiscent of a sanitarium. The imperial knight muttered an item that came to mind.</p>

<p>“Sedatives?”</p>

<p>"Not that good. It's some kind of secret potion, and a very bad one at that."</p>

<p>It was not due to the fatal wound and the blood that spilled. It was something more fundamental that caused this morbidly emaciated body and deadly appearance.</p>

<p>“Did you come to the front lines with a body that had been consumed by a disease?”</p>

<p>You would not have heard that name in the decisive battle at Sarajevo Fortress. It is likely that he was unable to go into battle due to illness, not due to his home country's preparations. This couple will not hurt the enemy in vain. The human body had to be destroyed to this extent before it could be neutralized. Walm guessed that the temporary increase in athletic ability, mental excitement, and insensitivity to pain were the effects of the secret potion. He was so determined. Torturing him was a waste of time.</p>

<p>“Chief Instructor, do you have any questions?”</p>

<p>"No. He just wants to talk to the commanders. He just wants to talk to the commanders, so I'm not going to stop him.</p>

<p>“Speak up, I'll listen if you have a last will and testament.”</p>

<p>It's a long way from this, but it's a good morning to die.</p>

<p>The imperial knight doubted his sanity, wondering if he was delirious, but Sylance's eyes remained rightly intelligent. He is not a sore loser. Just a feeling of sheer coldness. He is truly enjoying his last morning before his doom. The plane of his waist shook slightly.</p>

<p>"Hinode, I have done my duty. Everyone fought and died well. It was a fitting battlefield for the old general of Yarkuk, and for me, too, who was consumed by the disease."</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“It's that...”</p>

<p>"Which is the head of the church?　Which is the guardian general?</p>

<p>The sound of horse irons and an angry voice mixed with impatience drowned out the thin Sylance's voice.</p>

<p>“The head instructor and the head protector are over here!!!!”</p>

<p>It was Yogim who called out without a pause. It was no wonder. The other party was a fast horse, an alternative means of information transmission to the scarce communication magic tools that were in short supply. The imperial knight, staring at the horsemen rushing toward him from a distance, sensed something was wrong.</p>

<p>"No, wait. That's not the Orserica Saka messenger we sent out. It's the fast horse from the fort."</p>

<p>“Then it looks like the rear fort sent out the messenger first.”</p>

<p>The messenger, who jumped off his horse as if tumbling down, exclaimed under his breath.</p>

<p>"The main enemy force has entered the Celta peninsula!　Our side is in a complete collapse!</p>

<p>The Imperial knight gasped at the information he was told. The more he digested the words, the more he was struck by the grave situation.</p>

<p>“Nonsense, six mouths have been pulled out in such a short period of time!”</p>

<p>“This is a place that even withstood the Great Outbreak!”</p>

<p>Even if two of the three heroes of the Kingdom of Craist were to be concentrated, there would be several bottlenecks and positions like the Orzerica Slope, and reserves would prevent them from doing so. Walm's brain is shaken as he thinks. This could be a false alarm, a plot to induce an upheaval and force the front line troops to retreat. He denies it. Orselica, devastated by the onslaught and having lost the core of its garrison, has no such value. Rather, it would make more sense to prevent the withdrawal of the remaining forces.</p>

<p>"Where were you pulled out, Talmacane?　Asarina?</p>

<p>The enemy!</p>

<p>As the messenger announced the location of the main enemy force, Walm noticed the breathless Sylance. Like Ratu, he had died in his true colors. But the nature of his smile was the exact opposite. It was a sneer at the dismayed imperial knight who had done it for the last time. It was coated with sticky malice and amusement.</p>

<p>Episode 35 Unnamed Old Tree</p>

<p>The Yarkuk territory is a transit point between Celta and Refun. Belonging to the former kingdom of Ferius, this land is treated as an adjunct to the Refun area. The only role it played was as an ore transportation route. Among them, the ancient road defended by Fort Eskish is the least valuable due to its inconvenience. It was an open secret that half of the value of the position lay in the fact that it was a quiet position where troublesome people could be removed.</p>

<p>The man who had held the position of general for many years in the fort was Ratu, the chief of the hundred. He was an honest but ridiculously serious man with little sense of organizational politics. He was a smoky, troublesome man to have under your command. He was a hot-tempered superior officer who did not know how to get off his shoulders from soldiers he had not known for a long time.</p>

<p>He would often order his soldiers to run along the trails in their full equipment and to repair the fort, which was hard work. To make matters worse, Ratu always took the lead. The soldiers say that he is watched at all hours by a small group of sympathizers who are inspired by his words and actions, and he is unable to cut corners. The Highserk empire and even the Great Outbreak had forgotten about the existence of Fort Eskish, although they wanted their lives to be fully scattered on the battlefield. He was an old man, ignorant of warfare, ignorant of reality, and ridiculously large in stature. That was the evaluation of Ratu.</p>

<p>Ratu was in his room, staring at an old map. Rare communication tools were placed in the most important strongholds, and Fort Eskish had no choice but to rely on fast horses and wolfsbane to send messages. No further news had been brought since the departure of the Highserk knight from Lehun.</p>

<p>"Where is it, where does it go?</p>

<p>The notes and writing on the map were made by Ratu. He knows the area around the fort better than anyone back home, having done a lot of running and surveying.</p>

<p>“Either we've already passed through, or the rest of the troops are ...... leaving me behind again.”</p>

<p>Ratu is not a drafted militia member. He was a volunteer soldier of his own volition. He was inspired by the tales of heroism told to him by the elders of his village. Although it was not popular with those of his age, Ratu was so eager to learn it word for word that he memorized it as a child.</p>

<p>“You're getting wrinkles again.”</p>

<p>Looking down at his hand, he sees the evidence of aging that he cannot hide. It's not just the wrinkles. The muscles in his arms and legs were also beginning to deteriorate. He has been wearing armor for a few years now, and has been circling the animal trail to cultivate his physical strength, but that too has been a waste of time and energy. His body is still in a state of decline in the face of his approaching old age.</p>

<p>As a professional soldier, his role is to protect the assets and lives of his people. The fact that the fort is free from warfare is proof that he is fulfilling his duty. Even though I tell myself this, the fire that smolders in the back of my mind only grows stronger with age. A fortress and an old general left behind by the times. He says he volunteered to become a soldier because he wanted to be on the battlefield, but at this rate he will die of old age on his bed. What an irony. I would add that his heart is also so weak that he laments the environment in which he is placed.</p>

<p>“Old man, you can't take away my longing!”</p>

<p>He slapped his face to remind himself and went to the command center. The soldiers inside greeted him with a salute. Ratu responds with a salute and asks them to be seated.</p>

<p>“General Ratu, do you think the Demon Fire will pass through here?”</p>

<p>The one who asked anxiously was an old soldier who had been with him for a long time. The generals in the command center are the most unusual ones in the fort who adore Ratu. The generals in the command post are the odd ones who adore Ratu among the fort's soldiers.</p>

<p>“I am convinced that they will come because it is a forgotten fortress.”</p>

<p>The commander's assurance brought back the color to the soldiers' faces. The commander should not speak of his fears. This time, this time, this time - his determination was evident in the armor he wore. Aside from a few short water breaks, the men in command kept their gear on even while they slept. On the one hand, they want to be rewarded, but on the other hand, considering the villages adjacent to the fort and the militia who are like babies, they would prefer peace.</p>

<p>He was aware of this. It is foolish, selfish, and sinful to wish for a battlefield. But the longing for that heroic tale will never fade. The only thing Ratu can do is to prepare for the coming threat.</p>

<p>"However, I am not surprised that the militia that has gathered here is being dispersed. What is the head of the thousand people in the main domain thinking?"</p>

<p>“That's how early he wants to detect the threat.”</p>

<p>The chief of the thousand, who is high up in the chain of command, gave the order to deploy the militia even to the beast paths. It is no mistake that more manpower would increase the chances of contact. However, Ratu was also concerned that the soldiers, who were like babies, would be killed before they had time to cry out. To tell the truth, he would have preferred a concentrated operation at the fort. But as a soldier, his orders were absolute.</p>

<p>“The other side is using that Demon Fire, you know?”</p>

<p>"The imperial knight who burned Sarajevo. They say he controls blue flames, but what kind of man is he?"</p>

<p>“Isn't he a big man like an ogre?”</p>

<p>More than Ratu-sama?"</p>

<p>The soldier looks up at Ratu as if he were gazing at the mountains. The old general shook his head to hide his embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I am no better than an old tree with a gaping hole in it.”</p>

<p>“If Ratu-sama is an old tree, we are new shoots.”</p>

<p>A modest laugh echoed through the command hall. He had a strong yearning for the battlefield, but this atmosphere was probably not so bad either. Although I am a fool, perhaps I will be able to tolerate some peace before I die. Despite this calm feeling, Ratu was roused by a faint noise. The soldiers followed suit belatedly.</p>

<p>"The sound of battle!</p>

<p>“No way, this is...”</p>

<p>“It's the sound of metal scraping.”</p>

<p>Kicking off their chairs, the generals left the command post as if in a race, only to see the watchtower and archers exploding. The wreckage, clad in blue flames, rained down to the ground. It feels as if the flow of time has been delayed.</p>

<p>“Nooo, how dare they allow a surprise attack!”</p>

<p>The bells set up in the castle strike early to warn of the enemy attack. The heat searing inside the castle was already eloquently announcing the attack.</p>

<p>“General, it's the Demon Fire user, the Demon Fire wielder!”</p>

<p>Frenzy is just what it sounds like. A slumbering, recently replenished ten-man chief rushes in. The surprise attack left him in an ugly state, unable to even put on his protective gear to his satisfaction. He looked like a child trying to hold on to a big tree. Rattu grabs the shaken Jyuninchou by the shoulders and kisses him, saying, "Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in.</p>

<p>“Breathe in and breathe out, you will gather the militia and prevent the fire from spreading to the village!”</p>

<p>"What about you, Ratu-sama?</p>

<p>We are the demon slayers!　Come on!</p>

<p>Pushing the ten chiefs out of the way, Ratu runs straight into the center of the swirling hot wind of blue flames. He looked like a boy waiting for the harvest festival. The barracks were engulfed in fire, and the soldiers wandered about as if they did not know where they were going. Rattu, who had just taken a breath of air, exhorted, "I don't care how hot it is.</p>

<p>Those who can stretch the magic membrane, follow me!　What is this for? You volunteered for the battlefield. Do your part!</p>

<p>"Ratu-sama, over there. I thought that was the Demon Fire user!"</p>

<p>“Oh, how devilishly beautiful!”</p>

<p>He is a head and a half smaller than Ratu. He is of average build, not as big as rumored. However, his battle-tested behavior reminds everyone who sees him of death. Above all, the swirling blue flames. He brought the battlefield to Fort Esquiche all by himself.</p>

<p>“Is that Gustave?”</p>

<p>“That bastard, he's running away!”</p>

<p>The old veteran soldier, who had been carefully trained, filled his magical membrane and challenged the imperial knight. Sharp tips crossed each other as if they were fighting for a place to lay down their swords. At the third crossing, the axe-head of the axe-spear suddenly twisted and the spearhead bounced off.</p>

<p>“In a few moments, you'll see through my habit!”</p>

<p>Gustave, who is in a tight spot because of his habit, quickly turns his upper body away from the spearhead. The tip of the spear was successfully avoided. But a branch blade from the side of the axe-spear ripped through his neck.</p>

<p>“Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh!”</p>

<p>Gustave grabbed on with a muffled roar as blood poured out of him like a fountain. The two were already in close proximity. Ratu's prediction of an embrace was betrayed. The “Demon Fire” hunter tilted his posture, twisted his hips, folded his elbows, and scooped up the axe spear. The axe head, imbued with magic power, severed the man's waist and shoulders.</p>

<p>"You cut him?</p>

<p>“Gustave, you're getting ahead of yourself!”</p>

<p>“I can't believe he would fire a powerful blow from that distance.”</p>

<p>It was not originally a spear's stance. It was achieved by skillful use of his body. It was a technique he had acquired through countless deaths on the battlefield, the training ground. Gustave risked his life to bring it out. Everyone would say, "That is a knight. That is what a knight is.</p>

<p>“...... Gustave, watch in the underworld!”</p>

<p>The brave Gustave would not hesitate to reach the underworld by the luring fire. That is why he cannot show his men who have safely crossed over to the underworld an unflattering appearance.</p>

<p>“Sian, Rodriguez, follow my steps!”</p>

<p>The imperial knight, responding to the call to his men, recognizes Ratu. The glare in his eyes and the murderous intent behind his demonic mask told them that Ratu and his men had thrown themselves into the fray. The Demon Fire user's magical power increased, and his arm was extended as if he wanted to shake hands with the knight. It was not a sign of friendship. It is a stance unique to mage soldiers.</p>

<p>“Come on, get into my shadow!”</p>

<p>The two quickly moved behind Ratu. Soon after, a fireball was released, and it was vicious. It was the attack magic of a first-rate mage. A ten-man squad of soldiers without magical membranes would be no match for it. The Demon Fire master had recognized Ratu as an enemy and had given him a cannon to celebrate with. We must respond. He gripped the gold-bar in his hand tightly. I shook it millions and millions into the void. I had no choice but to shake it into the void. Now, the first battle was about to begin.</p>

<p>The gold bar held in the uppermost position is lit up with magical power. The steel batting rod, from the tip to the handle, transmits all of Ratu's physical and magical power. The “hard-hitting” blows down the exploding fireball. The fireballs were deflected to the sides, as if avoiding Ratu. The clear view of the imperial knight standing there was unchanged.</p>

<p>“So this is the battlefield.”</p>

<p>The old tree muttered as if chewing. The hot wind, which had gained momentum, drained the moisture from his mucous membranes through the magical membrane. The blue flames that ravage the things that should be protected. Yet, Rattu's spinal cord is numb from the immorality that flows through his body. He was enjoying the blue flames that ate away at his magical membrane and the deadly heat that stung his skin, even though it was difficult to admit. Boredom is a poison more painful than pain. Therefore, Ratu accepts the blue flame with delight.</p>

<p>Ratu was qualified to slay. He lifts the club, the point of which has dug deep into the earth, and shakes off the dirt that has stuck to the tacks. This is the first time in more than fifty years that I have been on the stage. He could not stand to have it stained with dirt. Rattu thrusts the club at him and declares, "Listen to me.</p>

<p>"Hear me, knight of the empire. My name is Ratu. I am the guardian of this fortress, and I will fight with you!</p>

<p>The heat rises in the old man's body. In all the northern countries, there is no better opponent to borrow from. Despite his aged physique, his heart returns to that of a child. Even the first person he admits to has changed in the face of his longing. Ratu, uttering a line from a heroic tale, was thrilled like a boy.</p>

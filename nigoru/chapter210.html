<p>Episode 56</p>

<p>A lamp made of Japanese hikarigoke (moss) illuminates the closed treatment room. Inside the room, even the distinction between day and night is blurred, and even the weather outside is uncertain. That is why Ayane was momentarily distracted by the thunder that rumbled loudly in the distance.</p>

<p>“Thunder ......?”</p>

<p>She mouthed the words and denied that there was any such thing. Up until now, the battlefield music of magic played by the mage soldiers arrives from Cape Raga. While I wonder what surprises me now, the frightening sound of destruction highlights the abnormality of the current situation. Like a slow-acting poison, it may be the result of a slow paralysis of the senses and sensibilities. The old me, who used to cower just by hearing attack magic from behind, is no longer with us. Ayane does not know whether to call it adaptation or degeneration.</p>

<p>“Ayane, I removed the foreign body from the laceration wound.”</p>

<p>“Yeah, sorry.”</p>

<p>Maia, stained with blood up to her elbows, not just her cuffs, pulls Ayane back to reality. Blood seeps from the patient below, his abdomen. Next to fire magic, earth magic, especially open damage from earth bullets, was troublesome. Fireballs, which fall into the former category, damage the human body through a combination of factors such as air pressure, heat, and debris. In contrast, earth bullets, the latter of which can cause both open and non-open injuries, are dangerous, but their troublesome nature lies in the contamination of the wound. If the gravel and soil clods are not removed and washed away, serious infections of soil origin can result. Maia removed that one element with water-based magic.</p>

<p>Pouring magic power into the laceration wound. Grasping the damaged area with magic power was a strange sensation, like putting a bare hand into a wound. He healed the broken ribs and connected the damaged blood vessels and nerves. I squinted and concentrated all my attention. Fortunately, the shattered ribs did not pierce any organs. Releasing the hand that poured the magic power, Ayane let out the fatigue she had accumulated with her breath.</p>

<p>“It's okay, I'm fine now.”</p>

<p>"Thanks, yo. How soon will you be able to move?"</p>

<p>The wounded soldier, breathing heavily and sweating greasily but not losing consciousness, said.</p>

<p>“As long as the blood I shed comes back, I should be able to move around in a few days.”</p>

<p>"That's good. I'll be back in a few days."</p>

<p>Ayane, with an ambiguous smile on her face, hushed herself not to think any more about it for now. We've made our decision. The people she had healed would be going back into battle, fighting the country that had once cared for them, killing each other's childhood friends who had been separated from them.</p>

<p>“Ayane, why don't you get some rest?”</p>

<p>Such an attitude must have been seen through. Maia smiled kindly. She is more exhausted than I am from guiding the surgical procedure and treating her with water attribute magic. I can't put her through any more burdens by giving her unnecessary care.</p>

<p>“I'll hang in there a little longer.”</p>

<p>"Understood. Let's work just a little bit harder."</p>

<p>Ayane decided to go on her way, wishing her neighbors to live. She was too tired to say, “I'm tired of walking,” and she couldn't make a weak sound. She could not say she was good or evil. Just by changing people and places, that ambiguous standard can be reversed. Therefore, I had no choice but to follow the path I believed in, in my own weak way.</p>

<p>It was when the thirteenth patient was taken off the operating table. Ayane heard a strange sound that she had never heard before. It was the sound of a human being's emotions being exposed. It was not the grunts and cries of a wounded person leaking from his or her wounds. It had a clear intent to kill and directionality.</p>

<p>“What--?”</p>

<p>The voice of Justan, who was in command of the guard outside, reaches Ayane, who is dismayed at the extraordinary situation.</p>

<p>"Enemy attack!　Intercept them!"</p>

<p>Don't let them go!"</p>

<p>Uninvited visitors. The intensity of the battle can be felt even through the outer walls. The house that had been rented as a healing center shakes under the projection of magic or skill.</p>

<p>“Screech, ah!”</p>

<p>Part of the ceiling collapsed, and Ayane clung to the operating table. The outer wall opened like a revolving door with an earth tremor as if a toy box had been overturned. The sealed room was exposed, and fresh air flowed in. A new entrance was formed by a huge, inorganic arm. It was not a human arm, but neither was it the arm of a demon.</p>

<p>“Goh, a clay figure!”</p>

<p>It was a clay figure created by earth magic. The twigs and arrows wrapped around its head were waved around like stupid hairs, and after checking the room, it tried to swing its huge arms down again.</p>

<p>“Ah, ah.”</p>

<p>Just before its order-of-magnitude mass is unleashed, the healing magician leaps in front of Ayane and unleashes the magical power he had been kneading. The ejected water bullet caught the distorted head. The head, which had been kneaded into a solid shape, was shattered by the impact and shattered like a piece of candy. Sunlight leaked from the collapsed outer wall, exposing the outside.</p>

<p>“I can't believe they could get in here without warning--what happened to the front line!”</p>

<p>Maia laments the war situation. Even Ayane, who is powerless in battle, can imagine what it would be like to have enemy soldiers sent to the treatment center. It was an unusual situation, to say the least, to be attacked without warning. A Craist soldier caught sight of the stunned girl and shouted, "There he is!</p>

<p>"There she is!</p>

<p>“Inside the wall opened by the golem!”</p>

<p>The opposing guards also tried to stop the enemy soldiers, but there were too many of them. One man cuts off Myard's soldiers, flips off a spear that tries to stop him, and dives straight into the healing area.</p>

<p>“Ayane-sama, get ready!”</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>

<p>I recognized the man. It might have been during an exercise or a mock battle in the Reharzen Knights. He was still young and somewhat shy. He was still young, and he repeatedly thanked me with a somewhat embarrassed look. Such an unusual behavior for the Knights of Reharzen must have made an impression on him. Two years had passed, and he had become an adult. However, his mouth, which was closed with a single letter, did not say anything. They were closed as if to stifle his emotions.</p>

<p>Maia shoots a water bullet without hesitation at her former compatriot, but it only ends up caressing the shadow of the knight of Reharzen. Maia skillfully manipulated water magic, but it was only her skill as a healing magician.</p>

<p>“Ah, that's fast!”</p>

<p>The density of combat experience and training is too different from that of knights and soldiers who make their living in combat. The attacker, who was crawling on the ground and changing his path erratically, easily avoided the second shot. The drops that dissipated were bounced off the magic membrane as if they were flowing. Even the aftermath was neutralized.</p>

<p>“Do not interrupt me, you treacherous bastard!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>The knight of Reharzen raised his sword and approached. Maia measured the distance between them and slashed at him with her sword for protection, but was repelled by a longsword slammed down from the top. The healing magician aimed to slash back, but the knight of Reharzen was able to use his healthy legs to pivot on one foot. The sole of his shoe pierced his soft abdomen. As if hit by a horse, Maia was thrown into the void. Rolling, splattering gastric juices and air, she screams.</p>

<p>“Ayyazane, run away!”</p>

<p>Urged to flee, she quickly rounded a passageway and was cornered in a corner of the room. She throws a handbasket at him in agony, but he cannot even avoid her. The knight's eyes were filled with love and hate. His eyes narrowed in anger and sadness, and he unleashed the tip of his sharp sword. Ayane was so terrified that she could not raise her voice and could only curl herself up.</p>

<p>“I won't let you!”</p>

<p>The knight turned around to the passageway that had been blocked by his back. What awaited him there was a sharply wielded blade. A high-pitched sound, as if steel had been strongly grinded together, echoed. After a moment of attack and contest, the blade precisely caught him in the throat, and the knight of Reharzen collapsed like a puppet with broken strings.</p>

<p>“Mr. Moritz!”</p>

<p>"Sorry, I'm late. I didn't get the message in time."</p>

<p>Maia, who had collapsed, uttered the name happily. The sweat pouring from her forehead and her erratic breathing told how far she had run. Contrary to his mild appearance and tone, the sword in his hand sips blood and intimidates foreign enemies. He was also unmistakably a Highserk.</p>

<p>The watery air lured him to his feet and he peeked fearfully at his feet. The knight, his carotid artery severed, stared blankly at Ayane, in the chasm of his dazed consciousness.</p>

<p>“...... sorry.”</p>

<p>If he reached out his hand here, he would be able to heal him as he once had. But surely he would fulfill his mission. The paths have already parted. And so Ayane left the knight to grow cold.</p>

<p>“Welcome Moritz, what's the situation!”</p>

<p>Justan, who had come out of the battle, asks the liaison.</p>

<p>“The main enemy force has landed from the rear of Cape Raga, I would say it is critical.”</p>

<p>"I see. Under siege, we can't expect a siege or reinforcements, can we?"</p>

<p>In addition, the enemy's target is Ayane-sama.</p>

<p>"They don't even want to take her prisoner. We have no choice.</p>

<p>Yes, we have no choice.</p>

<p>This was an exchange between two people who knew the atmosphere of the battlefield, which Ayane could not know. There was no room for her to interject.</p>

<p>"You heard that, boys. You may not be in your best form, but it's time to go."</p>

<p>The rapidly changing situation, the ignorance that comes from a lack of combat experience. Ayane, who had been left out of the battle due to these factors, exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What are you doing!”</p>

<p>The wounded soldiers who had been lying on their sickbeds began to prepare themselves at once. They intend to fight even if it costs them their lives.</p>

<p>“I didn't heal you with that intention...”</p>

<p>Ayane was about to say with emotion, but a soldier interrupted her.</p>

<p>"You're arrogant to say more than that, girl. You saved my life. I decide what to do with my life."</p>

<p>“I guess you're right.”</p>

<p>Hey, where's your weapon?</p>

<p>Where's my shoes? Who took my shoes?</p>

<p>A soldier who had just been on the operating table searched for his weapon, and a soldier who had just been wandering between life and death got up, resting his body on his spear. The experience of having healed so many before, alarms me how much blood and strength they have lost.</p>

<p>"You can't do it, ......?　Even if you could close the wounds, you're still in bad shape."</p>

<p>“They're not going to let you off the hook just because you're out of shape.”</p>

<p>If the guys in Reharzen had a cold, I'd be happy to attack them.</p>

<p>That's just the way it is in war."</p>

<p>His casual way of saying this conveys a kind of resignation and deep resolve. What should I do? What should I do? What can I do? I was almost in a cul-de-sac of thoughts. Then, Ayane couldn't believe her ears.</p>

<p>“Ayane, take off your clothes.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>The confusion was getting worse, but the healing sorceress didn't want to waste any more time, so she stripped off her own clothes. It was like changing a toddler's clothes, but embarrassment and fear prevailed over shame. Justan calls out to the others in a whisper.</p>

<p>"Get a set of armor, even if it's a little big. Layer the clothes on top of each other to fool them."</p>

<p>The mannequins were stripped of their clothing and put on overstuffed clothes. The smell of sweat, blood, and stuck-on grime irritates the nostrils. In the midst of all this, Ayane hears words that she can't put down.</p>

<p>"We form a false escape route into the siege. Moritz, disguise yourself as a stray soldier and let Ayane-sama escape to the military port city."</p>

<p>Even the less perceptive Ayane could see that he had come this far. She has Maia disguise herself, and they all act as decoys to help her escape.</p>

<p>“Wait, I, I, I, too.”</p>

<p>Like a spoiled child, the girl refuses to take her place in the sacrifice.</p>

<p>“I'm just a liability.”</p>

<p>It was selfishness as best she could, but Maia shushed her.</p>

<p>"Yes, missy. It's all right, it's all right. I'll take care of it here."</p>

<p>The soldier admonishes with a kind look in his eyes. It was as if the situation was the complete opposite of what it had been during the surgery. It was a lie. It's a lie, too damned gentle a lie. They all had the same face I had once seen at Dandurg Castle. Many soldiers, militiamen, had died telling their friends and family this. Maia peeked in, clasping her hands to Ayane's cheeks, who was lying face down, not wanting to see reality, and said, "I will join you.</p>

<p>“I will join you, I promise.”</p>

<p>It was not fair, there was no way she could fulfill her promise. Sneaky, sly, with a face like that. Ayane couldn't say that she would reject their resolve, Maia's wish, and stay here.</p>

<p>“Come on, go.”</p>

<p>"Okay!　The Highserk Imperial Command's lackeys are ripe for rough treatment, but they can't ostensibly cover for me. Just look at my ass and stick with me."</p>

<p>The liaison, exaggerated and emphatic in his clownish mannerisms, slaps his buttocks. Behind him, a charge began by the guard and wounded soldiers, wearing the spirit of a wounded beast in hand. The Royal Army of Craist, which had spread out around them, also changed formation to meet the counterattack. The net was forcibly closed to cope with the horde, and minute tears began to appear in various places.</p>

<p>"Open the way to the port city!</p>

<p>Don't be afraid, if you stop, you will die!</p>

<p>Keep going, keep going!</p>

<p>In the midst of the frenzy in the air, Ayane breaks away from the line of battle at the signal of Moritz, who has been calmly assessing the movements of the two armies. She leaves the scene, using them as live bait. A helpless feeling of guilt pulls her back. The liaison officer sees through such a lost heart and nails her.</p>

<p>"Here we go!</p>

<p>“Hu, ugh, ugh!”</p>

<p>Screams and shouts and the voices of my close neighbors heave in my ears. Their voices grow quieter and farther apart. Don't cry, don't sob. Ayane knew that her breathing and pulse would be disturbed by the amount of sobs, but she could not control her emotions.</p>

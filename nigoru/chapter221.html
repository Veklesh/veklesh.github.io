<p>4,000 men in the direction of the Lehun mines</p>

<p>Highserk Imperial Guard rearguard</p>

<p>Jaff Cavalry Battalion: 1,900 men; Light Infantry Battalion: 1,300 men</p>

<p>Royal Army of Craist</p>

<p>2,500 on Cape Raga, 1,500 on Orzerica Hill, 2,500 on Kagatsu Hill, 3,500 on Kokuro Hill, 2,500 on Talmakane Pass, and 3,500 on Asarina Hill. Total number: 16,000.</p>

<p>6,000 followers and remnants of the defeated soldiers on the ice road</p>

<p>3,000 in the Sarajevo area</p>

<p>4,000 in the direction of Refun</p>

<p>The Royal Army of Craist loses the Commander of the Knights of Reharzen, Gran, and the Deputy Commander, Sylance, along with many soldiers in the Battle of Orzerica Slope and the defeat at the landing on the shore of Cape Raga. After the deaths of the first and second in the order of succession of command, Deputy Commander Lars, who took over overall command, temporarily suspended the offensive to the Six Mouths of Zerebeth. In parallel with the reestablishment of the chain of command, he attempted to reorganize the units that had been defeated from the ice road.</p>

<p>While the front line is stagnant, many bodies of Reharzen knights, including Knight Commander Gran, are exposed on Kokuro Hill, located in the center of the Six Mouths of Zelebes, and rumors spread that exaggerate the truth.</p>

<p>While suspicions and unrest swirl among the Felians under the Kingdom of Craist's army, a rebellion by the soldiers of the former Kingdom of Felius occurs after the Duke of Myard's army insinuates that they will return to their former territory. The local commander was killed in a large-scale rebellion, and the Kokurozaka garrison took advantage of the confusion to launch a counterattack.</p>

<p>The Craist Kingdom troops on Kokurozaka, who had lost their commander and were split in two, were swept out of the attack. The rebellion that spread also reached Orzerica Hill. Deputy Commander Lash decides to temporarily abandon the Kokuro, Talmakane, and Asarina slopes, which are located west of the center of Rokkou.</p>

<p>He attempts to rally his troops to the traffic route used by the troops in the western end of the area during the invasion, but the rearguard, the Highserk Imperial Guard Jaff Cavalry Battalion, launches from Sarajevo Fortress. They break through the Craist Royal Army's siege of the fortress and enter Asarina Slope, the western end of the Zelebes Mountains outer perimeter line.</p>

<p>The Craist Royal Army attempts to retreat from the mouth of the attack, but is defeated by a pincer attack by Jaff's cavalry battalion and the Asarina garrison. The two units did not stick to the Asarina slope, but headed for the adjacent Talmacane Pass. The Coclos and Talmacane Pass garrisons, which had absorbed the rebels, also joined in, and the Craist Kingdom forces, caught in a net, fell apart after the defeat.</p>

<p>The Sarajevo besiegers led by Lash succeeded in joining forces deployed on Kagatsuzaka. The army was pressed to decide whether or not it should relieve its friends under siege northwest of Tarmakane, but decided against it, saying that with its unstable command structure and troops scattered in various locations, it could end up repeating the defeat of each individual unit. The remaining troops drawn from various parts of Rokkou were assembled and retreated to the provisional border line.</p>

<p>The Liberitoa Trade Federation, an ally of the Craist Kingdom, also withdrew the mage troops that had been dispatched with the surface fleet. As a result, the invasion of the Duchy of Myard led by the Kingdom of Craist ended with the loss of many knights, including the Knight Commander, and the half destruction of the main field army.</p>

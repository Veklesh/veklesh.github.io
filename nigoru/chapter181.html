<p>Episode 28</p>

<p>A fearless muddy stream that makes even a godless ruffian want to pray and cling to something. The church itself shakes as if gripped by a giant's hand. The brilliant stained glass shatters with a screeching sound, and drifting debris turns into a battering ram, pounding on the outer walls. Despite the crisis, Walm was blessed. Unlike the church building, which had been prepared for emergencies, the wooden houses were helplessly crushed by the tsunami, as were the residents.</p>

<p>Not only the support pillars, but the entire foundations were dug up, and not even the footprints of the residents were allowed. Rubble and sludge mingled together and covered the entire area. Silence reigns over the place after the bustle that brought ruin. Walm longs for the hustle and bustle, which he should be spared. But it will not be covered. Human activity had ceased, and the city was dead.</p>

<p>“Ugh.”</p>

<p>I thought I was used to emergencies. Even so, I was at a loss for words at the sight spreading out below me. If it were enemy soldiers or demons, the story would be simple. Just kill them. But what hit the town was a mudslide disaster. If it had been artificially caused, it would have been classified as a mass attack, but how should we have dealt with it? I could not join the other stunned people and stop thinking. Walm kept his claws clenched in his fists to maintain his sanity.</p>

<p>“Justan, let's decide what we're going to do.”</p>

<p>Walm shakes the former Kingsguard's shoulder as he mends his voice, which is almost trembling. Justan blinks, as if the madness of rationality, the imperial knight who has swallowed the situation, is incomprehensible.</p>

<p>“You, no, you're right. ...... church hall is abandoned.”</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the premise of the operation as initially presented is overturned. The church building, half destroyed by the mudslide, was hardly solid, and its value as a fortress had been lost. If they persisted in a siege, they would invite further danger.</p>

<p>“The ambush - or is it this way?”</p>

<p>"Yes. There is no need to worry about ambush anymore. The city itself is gone. But we can't take them all."</p>

<p>A voice full of conflict. Walm guessed what Justan was trying to say. If it was just the soldiers and Ayane, they could move, though their legs would be slow. The question is what to do with the wounded who cannot move on their own when that happens.</p>

<p>“Either way, we need to call Yamashiro for help.”</p>

<p>"......It's a blow, but we'll recruit those who wish to join us and leave the men behind. If not, I'll stay."</p>

<p>"What if the commander leaves? It's a terrible thing to do, but we should leave others behind."</p>

<p>Walm was not interested in being promoted in time of war, nor in taking over the chain of command, ever again. After all, he was a conscript who was only good at killing. The officers had to fulfill their duties as professional soldiers.</p>

<p>"I'll stay, sir. I need you guys for protection."</p>

<p>The man who came forward was a guard from the Highserk Imperial Guard. He was covered in mud up to his knees, but there were no external injuries, and his face showed a strong will. He did not come forward out of desperation.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Douglas. I'm going to select one of you from the cavalry group... Hey?　Are you listening to me?"</p>

<p>Walm, face to face, was amused at the arrangements for the move, when he looked away. They were not even listening to the voice of Justan, who was accusing them of being absentminded. After all, he had to look away. In a corner of the main street, a light shone in the darkness. It was a projectile flame. A chill ran through my body. A fireball approached in a regular circle. Walm knew from experience that when a fireball is approaching from the front, it looks like a regular circle. He extended his arm to Ayane, who was sweating to stop the miner's bleeding.</p>

<p>"Get down!</p>

<p>The difference in response to the call made the difference between life and death. The ability to avoid danger, cultivated through actual combat experience, moved the soldiers. On the other hand, the miners, who had never been exposed to attack magic, kept a puzzled look on their faces.</p>

<p>With such a look in their eyes, they pressed Ayane and Maia to their breastplates and covered them up. Immediately after, there was a shock. Flames danced in the bell tower, and red lotuses swallowed the miners. One of the cavalrymen who avoided a direct hit was also in the wrong position. The entire bell was thrown into the void, and together they fell to the ground with a screeching cry. The “skill” was not suitable for escorting, but it was the only one suitable for shielding against fire magic. Walm pushed them out of the way as they cowered in his arms.</p>

<p>"Yes, oh, Mr. Walm?　What the--"</p>

<p>“Go down the stairs!”</p>

<p>He quickly announces whether or not they are there, thrusts his axe spear against the outer wall, and jumps down from the bell tower. The newcomers who had crept up on him stayed and began their onslaught. Gray and pale red debris rained down from overhead. The evil of rampaging as one pleases. Easily identifying the point of fire, Walm pulls his feet out of the sludge and advances on the debris as a foothold.</p>

<p>“Concentrate, keep your mind flat.”</p>

<p>He repeats deliriously. I can't help it, I feel as buoyant as a new recruit. Calm down, breathe naturally, Walm tries to control his emotions. Still, his eyes, which should have healed, tingle, and his Demon Mask laughs. How could he forget? He had lost his irreplaceable eyes and his squad to that magic. No matter how much equipment you change, you can't fool the magic. Walm barks at his adversary.</p>

<p>"You're going to open the war with a surprise attack, Craist?</p>

<p>“I knew it!”</p>

<p>Without deception, the girl's voice echoes, out of place on the battlefield. It was Makoto Izaki, one of Craist's three heroes. Walm fires a fireball at the encounter, but the target evades as it glides over the sludge. This is one of the reasons why the water attribute holders are so fierce on the water and at sea. It was a unique walking technique that only they possessed, or a skill called 《水澄》. The troublesome mage soldiers of the other world were as skilled as the maritime magicians of the archipelago countries, plus they had the firepower to crush small groups of people. Wind blades and ice spears blocked their movements and prevented the imperial knights from approaching.</p>

<p>“Hey, there's Ayane over there!”</p>

<p>“Yeah, I know.”</p>

<p>Walm had hoped that the otherworlders' movements would be disrupted, as they had been at the field clinic in Sarajevo, but he was disappointed. They were supposed to be able to speak the same language, but they couldn't. Walm felt dizzy. Something was fundamentally wrong.</p>

<p>"Why?　You're one of the few people from my hometown!"</p>

<p>“Because I want Ayane to die.”</p>

<p>The girl smiles wryly. But the back of her eyes are stagnant like the sludge that sticks to the soles of her shoes. Why would she want her childhood friend to die? As his mind is about to be dominated by the question, a literal spear is coming at him. The axe-head flicked the spearhead, and the spears stabbed at each other in a tangled trajectory. He twists out the spearhead, which slips into his chest. I didn't remember being so geeky as to miss it in conversation.</p>

<p>Walm tried to reap the second one with a “hard blow,” but mud mixed with debris came down on him with a sickle. He was instantly clad in Demon Fire and left the scene with a hot blast. The disguised soldier who had come to slash at him also slid away from the muddy surface with 《水澄》.</p>

<p>“There are only a few soldiers who can accompany me in this sludge, so I wish you'd stop.”</p>

<p>We should kill them as soon as possible, even if it's just for a second. Intuitively, Walm realized. The church hall will be seared a little, but there is Maia, who has mud and water attributes. He would not die. Walm was about to launch Demon Fire in earnest, but the familiar girl's voice choked it.</p>

<p>"Ugh, ugh, why, Makoto!</p>

<p>Even Walm remembered the traces of magic. The girls had been lured into the other world and had been working together for a long time. There was no way they could have overlooked the familiar magic. I wanted to curse Justan for failing to stop them, but he too was busy dispelling the swarming evil.</p>

<p>“Why, are you serious?”</p>

<p>The Craist Kingdom's pride and joy, the mage soldiers, were also out of action. While catching Walm at the edge of his vision, he stared at the nearly collapsed remains of the bell tower with an expressionless face like a noh mask.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I don't know why. I don't know, I don't know."</p>

<p>Ayane's voice is weak. Makoto's face, which had remained calm, contorts sharply.</p>

<p>“......Ayane was a good friend to me,” he says. But you can't go home because you're helping the enemy in a foreign country!　Don't be silly. I'm not sure what to do about it, but I'm not sure what to do about it. Oh, Yuto will be so happy to let it go. Ayane has always been the best for Yuto. Even after killing people and spending sleepless nights together, even after dismembering enemy soldiers on the battlefield, all he could talk about was the one who wasn't there. Don't be ridiculous, Youto has always treated me as second best!</p>

<p>Emotional breakdown. A disgusting and unreasonable argument. That's why I know, because it's for Walm. The spirit has been worn out on the battlefield in the face of a horrific reality. The answer to what happens if you keep killing people in a world where human life is light was right in front of his eyes. An alteration of humanity, a plastic deformation at that. This would leave a permanent strain in the dark heart. Walm has maintained his humanity by coming to terms with reality. What is the difference between himself and Makoto? Is it his environment, his aptitude for battle, or his age? With a face filled with madness, the girl shouted.</p>

<p>"You're in my way. Now ah!　The three of you will never choose me no matter what. I've learned that painfully in this world. It's better to kill those who get in the way ...... and get along with the traitor and die quickly, Ayane."</p>

<p>Words of separation. The attack magic about to be projected into the church hall is not a threat. Regrets are meaningless, but he should have killed her with or without saying so. Verbal reconciliation is already unattainable.</p>

<p>"You've said your goodbyes!</p>

<p>“Don't let your pretended protector get in the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>Walm unleashes Demon Fire. The attack magic and the blue flame burst into flames as if they were fighting each other. Shock and raging flames poured down on the ground. The muddy earth was scorched dry by the hot wind. The steam and evaporating moisture was like a scream. Blue flames illuminated the ground in place of the falling sun.</p>

<p>Episode 61</p>

<p>The lake surface was in such disorder that it looked like an overturned toy box. The ship was collapsing, with the contradiction that it was on fire on the water. The damage to the drifting girls varied. Flooding from the breach holes, crushing of the superstructure. Another ship danced with vivid flames of explosion. The backbone of the ship, the dragon bone, was blown off and broken in half, the hull creaking as if in despair, and the entire crew was lured to the bottom of the water.</p>

<p>Mixed in with the drifting pieces of wood, the bodies of the dead, still lying prone on the surface of the water, drift right and left. The sound echoing through the hull of the ship was the fearful knocking of the drowned bodies as they were scraped and crushed on the ship's bottom. The ship did not slow down. The battle was not over, but it was raging.</p>

<p>It was a fleet battle. It was a major undertaking in which the navy and sailors put their very existence on the line. Donik, one of the water magicians of the Duchy of Myard, was no exception. He wanted to go to the decisive battle on the water right away, but he remained tied up on the ship until he delivered the cargo he was carrying in the hold. He was shaking with impatience and imagining the whereabouts of the water battle in the distance when he heard the following message.</p>

<p>“Enemy waterborne magician approaching from starboard forward!”</p>

<p>The ship was not just a block of wood. It was a mass of people, a living organism, Donik had always thought. When the eyes of the lookout sounded the alarm of a looming threat, the sailors reacted as they had done in training and in battle. The archers pull out their loaded crossbows, and the sailors pass around their spears, one after the other, which also serve as throwing spears.</p>

<p>Donik is no exception. He checks the condition of the cutlass on his waist with a stroke and receives the spear. The firepower and mobility of the water sorcerer as a military discipline are put to use when attacking enemy vessels. Therefore, it was a given that waterborne magicians would be the ones who would be the ones to drive out the waterborne magicians. Bows and spears on board are the last line of defense. As Donik's foot hung over the ship's hull and he jumped to the surface, he shouted, "Wait, friendlies!</p>

<p>"Wait, friendlies!　It's a friendly water magician."</p>

<p>“Donik, are you sure!”</p>

<p>The sullen voice of the captain, who was in command on the aft deck, echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, a fraternal soldier. ...... Perhaps a sailor from the Zelute."</p>

<p>Donik's eyesight was not as good as the lookout's, but when it came to identifying the water mages, it was a different story. He was not close to all of them, but they had fought each other in ship-to-ship battles and maneuvers. It would be difficult to mistake them.</p>

<p>“Lookout, how's it going?”</p>

<p>The lookout, slightly delayed by the captain's urging and looking annoyed, amended his report.</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir, it's a friend of mine.”</p>

<p>“Next time, don't make a mistake.”</p>

<p>In normal times, a reprimand and instruction would be unavoidable. But this was a crisis. The captain did not pursue the matter, but ordered the following instructions.</p>

<p>“Pick it up immediately, I want the battle situation.”</p>

<p>Flagships and larger vessels would have been loaded with communications equipment, but this was too much for a convoy consisting of one warship and two merchant vessels. The recovery of a projectile force of surface magicians would be important not only for simple combat power, but also for clearing the fog of war. Donik grabbed a rope ladder that had been installed on the edge of the ship and called out.</p>

<p>"Go around to starboard!　I'll throw the rope ladder."</p>

<p>The water sorcerer was no longer there, drifting unsteadily like a drunken binge drinker. His outstretched arms cut through the air several times before finally grasping the rope ladder. He didn't even have the strength left to climb it on his own.</p>

<p>"Hold on! Hey, let's pull you up!</p>

<p>Donik and his companions pull up the rope ladder. The suspended water magician sat on the deck like a fish on land.</p>

<p>“Here's some rum, swallow it.”</p>

<p>The bottle he offered was a bottle of rum from the archipelago countries distributed through the Flame Emperor Dragon Corridor. The ties between the Highserk empire and the archipelago countries behind it are growing stronger by the day, and not just with this one product. The rum was proof of this.</p>

<p>"Thank God. I ran out of magic power and was about to sink into the water."</p>

<p>Because he had prioritized walking on the water, his magical membrane had melted except for his legs, and his body was as cold as ice. He looked like a dead man. The sailor, unable to bear the sight, pulled a repair sail from the hold and placed it over the water magician's shoulders. He exhaled white breath and asked his compatriot, who was still trying to catch his breath, in rapid succession, even though he knew it was cruel to ask.</p>

<p>“The mothership was the Zelute, where are the others?”</p>

<p>“We sank, we got hit by a barrage of enemy mages.”</p>

<p>“No way, they were sunk!!!!”</p>

<p>The ship that Donik boarded was also a warship, but it was an old woman classified as old. The Zelute, on the other hand, was a newly built ship constructed at the end of the prosperous era of the Kingdom of Canoa, before the war with the Highserk Empire escalated. It was a warship that imitated the hull structures of the archipelago's naval vessels. Donik could not hide his shock that it would sink in less than a few moments.</p>

<p>“Where are Xenot and Gafut?”</p>

<p>The captain asked somberly as he stepped off the aft deck. Both vessels are Zelute's companions, small but nimble and maneuverable warships. A long time ago, they were part of the mainline ships.</p>

<p>It was sunk when it collided with the enemy's first-class ship."</p>

<p>“What about the ...... flagship Sprix?”</p>

<p>The worst imaginings passed through his mind. Fearfully, Donik asked.</p>

<p>"Alive and well. Still fighting tail to tail with the enemy fleet. I've been left behind in the fleet battle. The guys on land are in a tight spot. If we don't cut off their ice routes, the Celta Peninsula will fall. That's what this naval battle is all about."</p>

<p>"Ice routes?　The outer line of the Xeréves Mountains has not been breached?"</p>

<p>The captain spoke for the sailors who did not have a complete grasp of the situation.</p>

<p>"No, sir. The enemy has created a traffic route with ice behind Cape Raga. The navy has been ordered to use its entire force to defeat the Liberitoa Trade Federation navy and destroy the ice road."</p>

<p>Donik was speechless. While the convoys were on waterborne transport duty, the Celta peninsula was in a critical situation. But who would have thought that the outbreak would be caused by a land battle, and an ice road built on the surface of a lake?</p>

<p>“Well, rest now, and as soon as we unload our cargo, our fleet will join the battle.”</p>

<p>It would take several hours, no matter how fast they hurried. Would they be ready for a decisive battle on land and on the water by then? Even the noisy sailors are silent at this moment. Bad thoughts were going around in circles. It was then that a voice sounded out of place on deck. An out-of-place voice echoed on deck.</p>

<p>“Hey, sorry for eavesdropping, but I've heard your story.”</p>

<p>A foreign object, a cargo, was crawling out onto the deck. It was the light infantry of the Highserk Imperial Guard, ordered to transport it from the Flaming Dragon Corridor at the port. Donik thought he had acquired immunity to the Highserk through his work in the military port city of Anxio and transportation, but he was terribly mistaken.</p>

<p>This lightly-armed infantry company would get into near-killing brawls here and there, and would muck about with the ship's equipment and cargo. The caged demons were probably a bit more docile. Compared to them, the Highserk we carried the other day was elegant and graceful.</p>

<p>“Rushing them won't make the boat go any faster.”</p>

<p>The captain, who had been exposed to their true nature during the short journey, took the initiative and nailed them. The Highserk man's squadron commander is the cohesor and absolute ruler of this band of water pirates. It was because of this tug of war that fatal collisions and accidents were prevented. However, a few precautions can turn the situation into a disaster. It was as deleterious as black water.</p>

<p>"For an old woman, she's probably fast. So, that ain't the place. It's not the time to be behaving and entering the port."</p>

<p>"You can't very well berth from the quay shore. We'll run aground before we even get close to land."</p>

<p>"That's not why. It's that simple. There are good places to destroy the enemy's lines of communication and scatter the cargo, aren't there?</p>

<p>There is no such a convenient place. Donik wondered, but the captain guessed, using Highserk's phrasing.</p>

<p>“You want us to ram the ship into the ...... ice road?”</p>

<p>"Are you insane!　The main fleet couldn't break through."</p>

<p>“The guys who prevented that breakthrough are probably playing with the main fleet,” he said.</p>

<p>But there are ships left behind. You're being too reckless."</p>

<p>"Your main force is because you challenged them to an elegant fleet battle, but don't tell me you can't go in there, even if you only think about going one way and throwing away the extra stuff. The elite and peerless Myard navy that held us back in the Four Nations Alliance battle?"</p>

<p>Donik was about to open his mouth to speak against the captain, who was seriously contemplating this crazy plan, when his shoulder was turned behind him. Like the sailor, he is a dark-skinned Highserk soldier.</p>

<p>“You'd better not interrupt a conversation between commanders.”</p>

<p>“Are you threatening me?”</p>

<p>"It's true. You don't want your jaw shattered and all you can drink is soup."</p>

<p>The frivolous behavior was neither a joke nor a lie, judging from the clenched fist of the Highserk commander. Knowing his background on the cargo makes it all the more convincing. Donik clenched his back teeth and chose silence.</p>

<p>“Jose, don't do anything unnecessary.”</p>

<p>"Squadron Leader, you would have put your hand out if I hadn't stopped you. ...... Captain, the navy has been ordered to attack the ice route with all its might. Wouldn't that be no exception for the convoys?"</p>

<p>“That's stretching it too far.”</p>

<p>“Captain, I'm asking if I can or can't.”</p>

<p>The captain asked the seamy squadron commander, who was full of hasty replies.</p>

<p>"Frankly, it's not impossible. But what are you going to do if I refuse?"</p>

<p>“If you don't comply, I'll go on a rampage with my men and take your ship.”</p>

<p>"Are you serious? Do you really think you can take it?</p>

<p>We'll die a little, but it'll be over before we finish two or three of those bottles.</p>

<p>The Highserk said blithely. The clear declaration of mutiny sent the whole ship into a deadly frenzy. The sailors had weapons in their hands, but how much use would they be? Donik, who specializes in combat, knows. If this man swung his battle-axe, the entire captain and the sailors would be easily carried across the ship. He even had a magical membrane wrapped around the blade of his axe. His crew followed their master's example.</p>

<p>“So, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p>It was not a threat. That is how much these load have a bloody track record. In the clash at the provisional border line where the country collapsed after the Great Outbreak and its aftermath was still unsettled, they were the bloodthirsty kill-all squad that Liberitoa feared the most. They range from hatred-fueled avengers to the most guilty who were almost hanged in the penitentiary. A former punishment squadron, they are like the vices of the Highserk empire boiled down. Such people follow their company commander like infants. It is easy to dismiss them as charismatic. In battle, the violence and insanity of the group is unifying. They have no family, no friends, no neighbors, but they have that man. The battle continues on the lake, but no longer. The silence that flows through the air disturbs even their breathing.</p>

<p>"Captain, I know it's funny for me to say this, but I have one last thing to say. I know it's funny for me to say this, but I'd like to say one last thing: I don't want to see our country destroyed twice without being able to do anything about it.</p>

<p>The man says with a straight face, his tone and voice changing. The sincerity of his words was even worse. It was a clear ultimatum. The captain suddenly closed his eyes and let out a sigh. Then he continued.</p>

<p>"We will change course. Our target is the enemy's line of communication, the ice route."</p>

<p>Reluctantly, a man-to-man collision was averted.</p>

<p>“Oh, sorry for threatening you.”</p>

<p>“That's a cheap word. ...... I expect results commensurate with my actions.”</p>

<p>"Leave it to me. I'll leave it to you. These guys here are a bunch of assholes, but they're all good at war."</p>

<p>The only result was that Donik disliked the man even more. What's the big deal, there are no detainees. There were several times as many ships and water magicians. What he disliked most of all was that the big talk wasn't a lie. They were good at war. The magic that aimed at the mast and the water sorcerer who cut into it were cut down by those Highserk men.</p>

<p>“Stop, don't let them pull it out!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>"What the hell is this wind!　Damn it, I can't keep up."</p>

<p>The ultimate culprit was the flames that suddenly broke out on land. The whole town was dyed blue. From a distance, it may have looked beautiful. But that light was a blue flame that did not allow people to survive. Riding on the hot wind, the fearful screams of the victims echoed. The swirling flames even affected the surface of the lake. The lake wind, disturbed by the hot wind, pushed the sails as if they were being forced into the ice channel.</p>

<p>"Ha ha ha, great welcome. Walm, there you are!"</p>

<p>Running alongside the mothership, Donik caught the screaming Highserkers, blood spurting from their jointed bodies. The blood trickled down as if laughing, as if crying. As they neared the ice road, Donik jumped from the rope ladder onto the boat.</p>

<p>“Geez!”</p>

<p>An enemy water magician screamed as he tried to go deeper. It seems that that company commander is also good at throwing projectiles. A mere spear pierced through the improvised water wall. I even felt pity for him, even though he was an enemy.</p>

<p>“I've never seen this scenery before.”</p>

<p>I couldn't help but laugh at the approaching ice road. Whether out of desperation or contagious frenzy, the sailors show a strange sense of elation and calm. In the meantime, the speech has begun. Unlike the commander, it is profane and coarse.</p>

<p>"Listen up, scum!　Many decent Highserk soldiers died in the Battle of the Four Nations Alliance and the Great Outbreak. What we have here is a bunch of scum who have failed to die. They are the cunts who couldn't fight while their comrades-in-arms and people were in the underworld. That's right. After all, we are not dead like this. Personal principles and claims don't matter. What is required of us is death. I won't say anything complicated. Just follow my lead and kill like I do, that's all. Speak out, stamp your feet, and kill the enemy!</p>

<p>The deck shakes with the stamping of feet. He must be a great commander. Donik was even impressed that the scraps, which had been called unrepairable, were following him.</p>

<p>“All hands, prepare for impact, we're coming aboard!”</p>

<p>Every scrap from the ship was dumped into the water. A tailwind, influenced by the hot air, pushed the old man like a caregiver. The old woman, who had regained the beauty of her new-build days, did so and crashed into the ice. Shocked from her feet, Donik's body literally floated in the air. The impact choked him.</p>

<p>“The ship, the ship is ramming us!!!!”</p>

<p>“Get out of the way, get out of the way!”</p>

<p>“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...”</p>

<p>The ice road, which was Craist's foothold, is smashed by the three ships and scattered with their hulls. The Craist soldiers who were on the march were submerged one after another. Unlike sailors, land soldiers are not expert swimmers. And with the weight of their armor combined with the freezing surface of the water, drowning was inevitable.</p>

<p>"All right, aaaaaaah, you guys, let's go!</p>

<p>It was as if he were saying this not only to his men, but also to himself. Blood seeps from the sewn skin. The man's smile was fierce and his eyes were cloudy like sludge. Then the water magician realized. A fresh hatred, as if a compatriot had just died, the owner of a skin of a different color that had been sewn together....</p>

<p>From his wildest fantasies, Donik reverted to reality. The man who had jumped off the bow of the ship a step ahead of the others plunged into the midst of the confused enemy. A mere soldier would have been recklessly isolated from the enemy. But that was not to be. With his body covered with a magical membrane, he swung his axe. With just one shining swing, several soldiers were cut down to a single letter. It doesn't matter the rank or the type of soldier. There were still some Craist soldiers who tried to stop him, but they were smashed, kicked away, or submerged in the water. As if lured by the light, the man runs straight into the blue flame.</p>

<p>“Open fire and send the ladies to the underworld!”</p>

<p>After gathering sailors from the three stranded ships, the captain ordered them to be cremated. He discarded the unnecessary, but only preserved the oil.</p>

<p>“We'd been so careful with the fire for so long, I didn't think we'd have to burn the ships.”</p>

<p>The fire-attribute cooks in charge of the kitchens on each ship went around lighting fires while complaining.</p>

<p>“Captain!”</p>

<p>What should I say to the captain as he stares at the burning ship? Donik was at a loss for words, but he couldn't believe his ears.</p>

<p>He was an old man. He didn't have long to live anyway. It was a big cremation."</p>

<p>He even seemed to be enjoying it. Donik laughed, caught up in the unnecessary concern.</p>

<p>"Ha, yes. The attendees from other countries are happy too."</p>

<p>"So much for the funeral. We'll follow that Highserk man. I'm sorry to leave, but I'm not going to share my fate with the ship."</p>

<p>The ice road was already paved red. The Donniks can continue as well as the minions who follow the man. The mayhem had spread to the coast, the bridgehead of the enemy.</p>

<p>Episode 11</p>

<p>My body was heavy as if it were covered with sludge. The surface of his body was literally melting away. Walm, who had been sprinting through a grove of trees with the night mail, sits up as if he had fallen down. Blood and flesh crumble and melt with a sound. The mask peeled from his face.</p>

<p>“Ugh, geez, hah!”</p>

<p>He spits out a vomit of semi-coagulated blood from his mouth. The clouded consciousness and vision are regained. The melted remnants flowed from his cheeks like red tears. The night wind was cold and icy, stinging my skin. Walm shivered and looked down at the surface that lay on the ground.</p>

<p>“Oooh, that war god sent us a hell of a thing.”</p>

<p>The Demon Mask shakes in response. A memory that should not exist passes. This cursed mask has interfered twice in unknown places. The first time was at a gravestone, where it created an air passage between the covering soil and the corpse. The second time, he moved the body slightly so that it would not be crushed by the Tyrant Worm's own weight.</p>

<p>Without the interference, it might have died. Still, the interference was within the realm of human reason. But the third intervention was an aberration. Walm's dying heart was pierced by his brother. Even in my stopped breathing and consciousness, I remember it. The great ogre had unilaterally forced him to sign a contract. He wanted me to offer a sacrifice in exchange for the restoration of his heart. My heart did indeed return. However, it was a product of consuming the sacrifices, and the greedy demon said that it was not enough.</p>

<p>It would have been better to have paid the six-figure ferry fee at the Sanzu River. If the contract is not fulfilled, the next thing that awaits you is collection. The target must be his own body. A heart that is familiar to the demon eye and the demon would be very useful.</p>

<p>"You want my body? You nasty demon."</p>

<p>Demon Mask trembled. A part of his memory has crossed. Denial is transparent. In the back of my brain, the words of the offerings the demon uttered are etched in my mind. A struggle accompanied by a shout, a pile of corpses, and an offer to pay the offerings. Among them was my brother, my immediate family.</p>

<p>Impatience, dismay, determination. I think back to Hayes' emotions as experienced through his own and the Great Demon's eyes. He would have weighed his past and present family in the balance, and when the extraction failed, he would have been ordered to assassinate him. It is appalling that a nation would order a military operation targeting an individual. At the same time, I am aware that I have done just that. We burned many Liberitoans in the eastern border battle, in the Refun mines, and in the Sarajevo fortress group. As a soldier, it was even excessive. Perhaps they are similar as brothers, but like Walm, his brother is strangely honest and serious. They would fulfill their roles as soldiers of the nation to which they belonged.</p>

<p>He lets out a sigh of resignation. Military operations within the provisional borders, as Highserk soldiers, they are obligated to return to the imperial capital as soon as possible and report back. But Walm fishes in his pocket with a slow hand and pulls out a reddish-black, damp cigarette. It is lit in the darkness. The purple smoke in his mouth tastes bitter, mingled with the taste of rusty iron. He understands that this is a kind of escapism. After all, he is a foolish and weak person who at one time fled to alcoholism. Even so, he needed the purple smoke to maintain his mental balance.</p>

<p>His face trembled with reproach. When he blew out the white smoke and answered, the Demon Mask trembled as if in a rage. Walm's forehead wrinkles and a frown appears on his face, but he lets out a small giggle. He leans lazily against a tree and smiles a wayward haze. This is not the cudgel-wielding older brother in the forest of his childhood.</p>

<p>He has crossed countless death lines and become a soldier in the struggle, just like himself. The next time they meet again, they will probably kill each other without saying a word. They will not be brothers, but soldiers who are enemies. In fact, they may be happy for each other. Looking up at the heavens, the stars in the sky and the twin moons shine as they usually do. The twin moons shined in the same way as usual.</p>

<p>The sky is a place of peace and tranquility.</p>

<p>The military activities of the Liberitoa Trade Federation in the territory under its control had an impact on the imperial city of Varigend. A certain number of secret agents and operatives were captured, but the situation was not good. It was nothing more than an example and a reprisal. Highserk does not have the capacity to scrutinize and select visitors.</p>

<p>The convoy to Myard was not postponed and departed on time. The corridor is one of the byproducts left behind by the Flaming Dragon that brought down the Imperial City. Mountains and rivers equally melted down and became transportation corridors. Walm has no idea how many years and manpower would be required to recreate this by human hands.</p>

<p>The flora and fauna were scorched by the raging fires, the incombustible rocks were stained with soot, and some streams were dried up. Although the area is maintained as a transportation route, it is locally barren, not unlike the homeland we have come to know. Despite the gloomy scenery, a dull, shiny rubble glimmered in my eyes. Exposed on the ground, Walm grabbed it and rolled it in his hand. It is not a brilliant object, but he considers its yellowish color.</p>

<p>“Is it glass?”</p>

<p>Scattered around the area were similar blue-green and blackish gravels. Friug replies to Walm's quizzical look. Since one of the raids, the area had been under close surveillance by the company commander.</p>

<p>"In this area, the Central Area Army, which aims to defend the imperial capital to the death, had drawn up a defensive line. The Flame Imperial Dragon devoured them, and the flames released during the battle melted the earth and created glass. It is an abomination, but the thing refined ores and glass that can only be extracted around volcanoes."</p>

<p>Natural glass, a melted product of plant ash and sand, a byproduct of the ever-increasing temperatures, lies on the roadside. Other miscellaneous impurities dotted the area with glass of contrary colors, despite its proximity. If it were only glass made of plant ash, it would simply be glittering, but this is the Flame Emperor Dragon Corridor and an old battlefield. I didn't want to think too much about some of the raw materials.</p>

<p>"There are guys who make a living collecting quality glass and ore. It's kind of creepy considering the location, but it's a source of livelihood for families and orphans who have lost their workers. They still stick to the back of the line."</p>

<p>The platoon commander who was bringing the Transportation Corps together raised his voice. His skin was blackened from years of exposure to the sun, and his legs, which were two times thicker than his upper body, suggested that he had been beaten up in the field.</p>

<p>“You're using the ...... convoy as a free escort.”</p>

<p>Friug looked behind him as he let out a sound that was a mixture of dismay and admiration.</p>

<p>“They're a tough bunch, sir.”</p>

<p>Walm asked the platoon commander of the Transportation Corps, who gave a small smile, as if to confirm.</p>

<p>"Hody platoon, right? Do you use this corridor often?"</p>

<p>“We spend our days going back and forth, except for a few days when we load and unload and rest in the area.”</p>

<p>“...... You're a hard worker.”</p>

<p>“Ha, I'm flattered if you're flattered.”</p>

<p>“Haha, I'm flattered if you're flattered.” "I'm not flattered or joking. I'm not kidding.</p>

<p>Walm is not flattered, but speaks from the heart. One of the main duties of infantrymen is to move on foot. The skin and nails of the uninitiated are repeatedly peeled off due to wear and tear, and the skin aches. On the other hand, the Transportation Corps carries a load that exceeds their height and pulls a fully loaded cart. It was easy to imagine how much hard work it was. Infantrymen were sometimes sent out for general construction work, but when they were deployed to occupied areas or permanent positions such as forts and fortresses, they were basically on standby for periods of rest, which was not a small number of times. However, the Transportation Corps continued to move without a break. What or who would you call diligent if you don't call this diligent?</p>

<p>"Oh, my God. I'm embarrassed. ...... There have been those who have mocked us as spoiled horses pulling carts and as poor soldiers, but you are the second person, after the now deceased god of war, who has said so."</p>

<p>The commander of the Transportation Platoon scratched his cheek. Walm's dismay and admiration are rivaled by the fact that Gerald Berger, the god of war, appears everywhere, even after he has crossed over into the underworld. The secret of his success in maintaining his leadership and fighting spirit, which could be called a mad dash, may be the care he takes for even the most junior generals and the care he takes for the blasting of his troops.</p>

<p>“I don't want to be compared with the god of war.”</p>

<p>"I'm really grateful to Captain Walm and Captain Friug. The reason my Transportation Corps was able to retreat to the east was because the demons in the Dandurg area were suppressed. Without them, we would have been crushed to death."</p>

<p>"I didn't know that. Was Platoon Commander Hody also engaged in the transport in the direction of Felius?"</p>

<p>Friug let out a word of surprise. That would be true. Unlike infantry and cavalry, it is extremely difficult for the slow Transportation Corps to escape Great Outbreak due to its characteristics.</p>

<p>"We were originally part of the Eastern Area Army, and were saddled with the Felius Area Army following the invasion of Felius. Great Outbreak occurred during the transportation of provisions and fodder to the Sarajevo Fortress Group, and from there we have been working to transport materials for the construction of the defensive line."</p>

<p>Walm remembers that the defensive line constructed in Myard consisted of three key locations, including Dandurg. This platoon leader was apparently engaged in one of them.</p>

<p>“After the front collapsed, we went to the east in the size of a mixed company with a mixture of soldiers and units. ...... I never want to walk that road again.”</p>

<p>The memories of the road trip must have come back to him. Hodie's eyes leak into emptiness. Walm, who shared a part of the story, stopped to mention it further. It must have been a literal bloody road, not to mention the explanations.</p>

<p>Through bitter reminiscences and the exchange of information on the corridor and other areas, the group marched on, deepening their mutual understanding, and in three days, they repelled five small-scale demon attacks. Despite the wounded, no cargo was damaged and no one was killed in battle, and Walm and the group entered the granary established at the midpoint of the Flame Emperor Dragon Corridor. The Duchy of Myard, the ancient castle of Dandurg, where the memories of the abominable past lie dormant, was just around the corner.</p>

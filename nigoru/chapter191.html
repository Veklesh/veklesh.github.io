<p>Episode 38</p>

<p>Soldiers descended a winding slope as distorted as a toddler's scribble. The gently sloping, yakken-shaped terrain was evidence of the many years of traffic. A sparse column of soldiers was moving along the mountain path.</p>

<p>"It's a terrible state of affairs, isn't it?　The physical strength is uneven, but they haven't even completed their basic training."</p>

<p>Deborah scratched her head as if to cover her embarrassment at the sight of the man's untidy room. Walm defended the poor head instructor.</p>

<p>“He's somewhat more civilized than Highserk, just because he has training.”</p>

<p>“What, are you trying to console me?”</p>

<p>“I wish I was, but I mean it.”</p>

<p>On-the-job training sounds good. It was a method of education that allowed peasants, who did not know their way around, to learn their jobs by experiencing the practicalities of combat. The bloody instruction of their predecessors transformed the inexperienced into soldiers in a short period of time. In addition, the generous recruiting guidelines of the Highserk Imperial Army required neither resume writing nor interviews. All that is required is a healthy body and one's own life. What a wonderful organization and workplace!</p>

<p>"The reinforcement of the imperial knights is reassuring.</p>

<p>"I'm glad it's you guys who know what you're doing. After all, we were about to get lost on the road."</p>

<p>Walm saw Ayane off to the field clinic set up on the front line, but what awaited her was the problem of the troops assigned to her. While everyone wants a firearm that can be maneuvered around, Walm is a member of the Highserk Imperial Army. In addition, it would be difficult to incorporate him into the Duchy of Myard, which was concerned about friendly fire due to the nature of his skills. The Justus Brigade, which has a large number of Highserk Imperialists of old, is also in the midst of delaying tactics on the front line.</p>

<p>Their affiliation is in limbo. While the passive idea of standing by as a reserve force to put out fires was seriously considered, it was Deborah's training squadron that raised its hand. During their training period, they are somewhere between a standing army and a mobilized militia. If they could uncover the true intentions of the rulers, they would be assured of a certain level of training, and it would not be regrettable if they were lost as collateral damage. Such was probably the intention.</p>

<p>"It's the end of the world if the knights are lost on the streets.</p>

<p>While the exchange of lighthearted words continued, Walm received a friendly call from behind him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Walm seems to be getting along ...... very well with his wife.”</p>

<p>He turned around awkwardly like a rusty doll. There he was, Yogim, Deborah's husband. Despite his usual soft expression, his eyes were not smiling at all.</p>

<p>"You idiot, it's disgusting how jealous men can be.</p>

<p>“Haha, what are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“Don't fool around.”</p>

<p>The strong leader's arms are tangled around Yogim. What are the commander and the assistant commander of the drill company doing on the march? Walm feels terrible heartburn at what he is being shown. At the same time, he realized that his experience as a soldier was a kind of switch. The better ones are better at this. One moment he is gently talking to horses and livestock, and a moment later he is gently stirring the guts of enemy soldiers with the tip of his spear. He asks his son for help, but Moyes doesn't glance back, perhaps in response to his parents' love affair with his body language. Walm strengthens his pace and runs alongside him.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you don't want a father-son grouping?”</p>

<p>“Uh, yeah, I'll stop ...... now.”</p>

<p>It's a roundabout complaint. No wonder he became awkward. But Walm couldn't shake the feeling of discomfort he felt at the brusque response. Moyes, who had shown his parents as much bottom-line strength as they had in Dandurg, was the one who should have been nervous like a new recruit. There was no way he would be as nervous as a new recruit. Besides, Deborah had told me that he had participated in the Battle of Eidenberg.</p>

<p>At that time, the area around the fallen capital had become a mowing ground for Myard's soldiers due to their defeat in the decisive battle. They survived such a hellish battlefield and returned to their hometown without being taken prisoner. Compared to that, the current situation is better. There are options available, though not many.</p>

<p>“I'm glad you have a sense of independence.”</p>

<p>Walm, who had been playing with his axe and spear, tapped his shoulder with the hilt of his axe and spear. Lack of time on one's hands is an affliction that can undermine one's rationality. The imperial knight's gesture is essentially the same as that of a twig-wielding boy.</p>

<p>“It looked ...... like such a fine thing, didn't it?”</p>

<p>“So that's the Orserica cut-through.”</p>

<p>At the end of the curve along the mountain was the duty station of the Nerry Company.</p>

<p>"Is that the Rokkou, the pride of the Zelebes mountainous outer line? On the return trip from Lehun, we passed through Kagatsu Slope, but that one also used a ridge, didn't it?"</p>

<p>“This is also a key point by cutting through and excavating multiple ridges.”</p>

<p>The traffic route, cut through a portion of the ridge, was a kind of earthwork, and anyone attempting to push through could be shot down unilaterally from the heights on either side. It was simple but solidly defensible.</p>

<p>"So this is the outpost. If the rear posts are combined, even a large army will be dammed up."</p>

<p>The preparations for the overland route of the predecessors who opened up the Six Mouths of Zerebeth were truly vindictive and paranoid. If we can build a defensive position like this, we can concentrate our efforts on the port and the fleet. This may be an expression of their pride in not being defeated on the water. From a military standpoint alone, it was far stronger than Eidenberg, and it was no wonder that the god of war, Gerald Berger, had abandoned it.</p>

<p>“During the Great Outbreak, the outpost was breached, but it seems that it was defended by a fort with a back-up position.”</p>

<p>"I like positions with vertical depth. I like deep positions, but I don't like to fall back when there's a rear.</p>

<p>I don't want to experience the endgame of repeated orders to defend to the death ever again. Still, once the habit of running away has set in, it is hard to correct. Unless the head of the commander and the nerves of the officer are replaced, the unit will be defeated again.</p>

<p>“By the way--”</p>

<p>He is still talking about the battle even though he has not yet seen the enemy. He is very much poisoned by the battlefield. Walm decided to follow the example of the couple behind him. Of course, he had no taste for shoulder-hugging their son for no reason.</p>

<p>“The six mouths of Zelebes are Orzerica Slope, Kagatu Slope, Kokuro Slope, Cape Gala - what was the rest?”</p>

<p>Walm's gaze flashed to Moyes, as if asking for help. To the distressed imperial knight, Moyse willingly spoke up with an answer.</p>

<p>“It's Talmacane and Asarina Saka.”</p>

<p>"How well you remember Talmacane and Asarina. I should at least memorize the key points of the friendlies, right?"</p>

<p>"I'll be in Celta for a while now. And my mother ......, no, my instructor made me run all six mouths of the Zelebes on the march of the drill."</p>

<p>Contingency marches are essential to deploy troops quickly to their destinations. Myard's army apparently repeated the practical maneuvers. Walm was impressed, but his interest turned to Moyes' gaffe. Walm, smiling wickedly and pursuing his blunder with silence, gave in to Moyes' full surrender.</p>

<p>“Chief Protector, um, I was wondering if you could keep this confidential from the head instructor and the auxiliary .......”</p>

<p>“What, what?”</p>

<p>A touch that amounted to rejection. Moyse's face contorted as if in despair of the world. He was too much of a mangler to be confused. Even an imperial knight would fear the retribution of the couple behind him.</p>

<p>“Just kidding, I'll keep that in mind.”</p>

<p>"Thank God. I don't want ...... to be chased around all night or teamed up until my face and butt swell up."</p>

<p>It's a funny story to hear from the other side, but they are a couple. Deborah's blows, in particular, literally blow up her body. An ordinary soldier would have shed tears and begged for help. It is still fresh in his mind that Walm was brought to the treatment center with swelling all over his body from the mock battle and was reprimanded by Ayane.</p>

<p>“Indeed, that beating was unfashionable.”</p>

<p>“Huh, even the chief guardian can endure that.”</p>

<p>The conversation was lively with sympathy from an unexpected angle. Come to think of it, Walm and Moyes had never spoken alone together in their long relationship. He is never at a loss for topics of conversation. The casual conversation continued uninterrupted until they reached the outpost.</p>

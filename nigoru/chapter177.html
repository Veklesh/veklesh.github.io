<p>Episode 24</p>

<p>Walm hesitates behind the crumbling bodies. How big was the attack? The Duchy of Myard has managed to make do with its scarce human resources, and has placed a new lord in the mountain castle that dominates Refun. Although not a small proportion of the old Ferius soldiers have been absorbed, the core is solidly made up of Myard soldiers. It is hard to believe that they have uprooted and defected.</p>

<p>“Aaaaah!!!!”</p>

<p>The attackers rushed at once to prevent us from thinking. The attacker tilts his posture to the left, thrusting out his axe spear, which is still smoldering, and turns to the side. A small thrust that refuses to get any closer is met with a deafening metallic sound.</p>

<p>A close encounter. It is not surprising that the first blow is blocked at a distance that does not allow the spear to show its full potential. As he continued to turn his wrist, a claw-like blade branched off from the tip of the spear and entangled with the longsword. The center of gravity is transferred to the hilt, and the axe spear is pulled like a tug-of-war. The soldier held on hard, trying not to let go of the sword even though his upper body was crumpled. As a result, the weapon remained in his hand, but he was led by Walm into the path of his comrades.</p>

<p>"Quickly, retreat!</p>

<p>Although his role was to keep the enemy from stepping into the healing area, Walm did not stick to the entrance. He had experienced enough on the battlefield to know that even skill can be subverted when dead soldiers are in close proximity. The positions of the bodies are switched, and the old Ferius soldiers between the imperial knights and the door are lost. Do they defeat the obstacle of the knight, or do they rush into the interior?</p>

<p>“Inside--”</p>

<p>"Concentrate!　First, this guy."</p>

<p>In contrast, Walm's thinking was quite simple. Eliminate the enemy before they enter the room. That's all there is to it. Walm, who had gained enough distance to maneuver his axe-spear, swung it. The blue light draws a semicircular path that leads to the underworld.</p>

<p>"Here it comes!</p>

<p>The old FELIUS soldier folds his sword and elbow at the approaching 《Heavy Strike》, and lays the blade down on the ground, readying himself for the attack. The axe head with its magical power pushes aside such defenses and rips from the flank to the chest. The axe head, with its magical power, pushes and pushes against him without regard to such defenses, and rips from his side to his chest. Blood gushes out from the breastplate, which has a straight groove carved into it.</p>

<p>“Gosh, baaaah!”</p>

<p>A muddled sound echoes like a clogged drain. Witnessing the death of his compatriot, the man behind him reacts quickly. The blood spurting out of him and the way he stabbed the man in the shadows was a thing of beauty. It was full of ingenuity and even a kind of admiration. However, his aim was not good. The path of the vermilion blade, stained with fresh blood, aimed straight for Walm's eye socket.</p>

<p>The narrowed pupils of the pupil correctly caught the line of the sword. The sharp tip of the longsword passes through the eyelids as if to snatch them. The eye that was born is still regrettable, even though it was muddy. Still, I don't dislike the magic eye, which neither rots nor hurts. After all, it sees the world well.</p>

<p>He slides the axe and spear to the tip of the spear, leaving it swinging. The blood returning to the spearhead acts as a lubricant, and the stone thrust, which is opposite to the spearhead, raises its head while being supported by the hip bone. There is no need for a fancy advance or a "hard blow. At any rate, the enemy soldier's body, which could not be fully braked, provided the necessary strength. The stone thrusts reduced the exposed soft throat and tore into the skin as if popping it open. The branch blade and spearhead fixed to the ground served as an anchor, transferring all of its weight to the stone thrust. Both arms drooped without power, and the longsword spilled from the fingers of its master, who had lost his breath.</p>

<p>“Ugh, aaaaah!”</p>

<p>The remaining soldier finally chose to follow his comrade-in-arms into battle, but it was too late. An axe-head struck him in the back of the hand, and his sword flew off with his fingers. By the time a sharp pain shot through his body, the tip of the spear had pierced his ankle along with his half boot. Deprived of resistance, Walm extends his arm and grabs the assailant by the throat.</p>

<p>“Ah, haa, aaaaah!!!!”</p>

<p>The soldier writhes in pain in his extremities, but it is not an injury that will kill him immediately. Walm, who has tightened his grip on the neck even more, asks, "Don't pant.</p>

<p>"Don't pant. If you want to breathe again, ask questions..."</p>

<p>Walm was about to pull the information out, but he catches the faint sound of flight and pulls his arm back. The remaining hand was on his hip, as if he were leading a woman at a ball, but it was actually an arrow dodging.</p>

<p>“Ah, ah, ah.”</p>

<p>One direct hit. The rest pierced the outer wall and the door. Even for a bowman with a powerful bow, it is extremely difficult to penetrate through the composite armor of a human being made of iron and flesh.</p>

<p>“The archers--three of them?”</p>

<p>A gasping, electrified breath tickles the ear. The arrow had pierced so deeply into the spinal cord that not even an arrowhead could be seen. The reassured archer shot a second arrow without regard to the swordsman. Walm, who had sunk his hips and kept his posture low, kneaded his magic. The shot that he must have corrected. This time, three impacts are transmitted through the corpse without missing a beat.</p>

<p>He knew the shooter's position through the corpse. On the dusty and sooty roof of the house, the archers reach for their arrows. The placement of the arrows may have given priority to the angle of fire and visibility, but it was a little too bold. In addition to the advantage of the high ground, the speed of communication between the archers and their comrades lined up on either side of them is certainly hard to ignore. However, this is only possible if the firing position is as solid as the archery range or if the target has no means of counterattack. The Ferius soldiers we faced in Sarajevo and Refun were more cunning. At least they were not so dense that they could be wiped out by attack magic by mage soldiers.</p>

<p>“Jump!”</p>

<p>The magic power swirling around the target, the imperial knight. The archers realized it belatedly, but the fireballs that were released flew into the houses without a moment's delay. The dismayed voice turns into a scream, and the entire roof blows off the archers and bursts into flames.</p>

<p>“Run away, you'll get caught in it!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>“Why is there a battle going on in the city?”</p>

<p>Ignited wood and pieces of flesh rain down from the heavens. The savory and repulsive smell of the fire pungent in the nostrils. There is no time to rejoice at having swept away all the people. The battle suddenly erupts, and the people who had packed the place flee. The attackers are rushing in to cut their way through the crowd. Looking closely, one can see that even an old Fellius soldier, whom Walm did not touch, has collapsed in a pool of blood.</p>

<p>“There were some who didn't have any inside ...... connection with each other.”</p>

<p>It was probably a soldier on Myard's side who was not part of the attack. The loss of a friend soldier was lamentable, but at least there was some relief in the evidence that there did not appear to be a rebellion in the entire Refun area. The problem is that there is no distinction.</p>

<p>"Anyone who does not want to die should stay away from the churchyard. We will cut them down, whether they are miners or allies."</p>

<p>Walm says a kind of precautionary statement. It is easy to understand, however, those who have no hostile intentions. They are trying to get out of here as quickly as possible. The assailants, on the other hand, rush in, pushing past the people who are in their way. It is not possible to burn down the entire population in the mining town with Demon Fire. I don't know what the reason is, but my “skill” is definitely not suited for escorting people.</p>

<p>"Hey, can you hear this battle cry?</p>

<p>Walm called out to the tightly closed studded door.</p>

<p>"How many are there?</p>

<p>"More than twenty men, at least that I can see, and I'll hold the front. The rest of you defend yourselves."</p>

<p>"Damn it, the cavalrymen, secure the back entrance and the armored door. I'll stick to Ayane-sama.</p>

<p>Through the door, Justan gave a shout of approval. He burns away the blood paste that clings to his axe spear with a blue flame and puts on his blood-drunk Demon Mask to appease him. Walm, now dressed and ready to go, invites the gracious guests to a welcoming party.</p>

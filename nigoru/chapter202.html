<p>Episode 48</p>

<p>My vision is narrow, as if I have wandered into a cave where I cannot see ahead. The sound of my breathing is disturbed, my heart is beating loudly, and my thoughts are disturbed by the battle cry. The enemy is right in front of me, and yet my role as a commander does not allow me to simply focus on the enemy. A narrowed perspective is out of the question on a battlefield where the situation is intricately intertwined. Losing the cradle of peace and the defender of the terrain, the plight of the boarders presses on Moyes' thoughts.</p>

<p>“Keep a proper distance between the two sides, be aware of shoulder width.”</p>

<p>Although the training squadrons have escaped from their combat virginity, they are still a poorly trained unit. The parents of the instructors have their hands full dealing with the knights of Reharzen and their squires. The chief guard, who was filling in for the defensive line, was sparked into a mortal combat with the enemy's fierce general. The scene was like a duel.</p>

<p>On the battlefield, there is no such thing as a perfect single combat. Naturally, both friend and foe attempted to spear and interfere with each other. The result was pieces of meat scattered around. Anyone who stepped onto their battlefield, friend or foe, was exposed to the wreckage. No one wanted to actively intervene in their world anymore. If they wanted to help indirectly, it would be more effective to bury the enemy in front of them.</p>

<p>"Let's stop the enemy at the boundary between the plain and the earthwork. Don't let them stab our friends in the back!"</p>

<p>Against the troops under Moyes' command, who were formed on the plain, the enemy broke through the friendly skirmishers and seized the top of the left wing of the earthwork. The men of the vanguard platoon, which had suffered a general collapse, were entangled by blades and blunt weapons and were killed one after another. If they ran to the rescue now, their conscience would be somewhat cleared, but what awaits them at the end of the melee is their mutual destruction. If that were to happen, the battle line would easily break down. A Myard soldier is cut from the shoulder to the waist, another is stabbed through the back with a spear, and another is stroked through the back with a spear and falls to the ground.</p>

<p>“Get through the gap in the ranks and get to the tail of the line!”</p>

<p>Moyes screamed, writhing in agony at the itch, at least. It is not clear how many of the defeated soldiers, driven back by the deadly blades, understood his words. Still, they instinctively dodged the raised spears and flanking troops. The Ferius soldiers, on the other hand, finally realized their predicament when the enemy soldiers they had been pursuing disappeared into the sea of people.</p>

<p>“Move back, move back!”</p>

<p>The tip of the spear swung down all at once, striking the Ferius soldiers all over their bodies, deforming their armor and making their bones creak. Even those who survived the first blow were repeatedly struck with spears two or three times, and were crucified to the ground, never to rise again.</p>

<p>The remaining enemies, however, are very few in number, and many of them do not make a protruding part, but descend the mound, forming an iron wall of spears and shields, as if to oppose Moyes's column. Their movements were slow and sluggish. Including the defeated remnants of the vanguard that intercepted them, the number of soldiers under Moyes' command was about 70. With this number, they must defend their left flank.</p>

<p>"Keep in step and thrust out your spears. Be in step with both sides, this is not the same as each of the other strikes we have been doing so far.</p>

<p>This was the first time anyone in Moyes' platoon had ever formed a line of spears in a real battle, even on level ground. It was awkward for a unit, and far from the ideal formation they had envisioned.</p>

<p>“Hit it!”</p>

<p>The two groups collided as if they were melting. Iron thorns entwine like thorns, making a deafening noise over the placement of the tips of their ears. Moyes is no exception. In this predicament, the soldiers will not move unless he takes the lead and shows them what he is capable of because he is the commander. The spears he has swung down rub against each other and bounce off each other.</p>

<p>The ear that dived through the iron thorns caught an enemy soldier in the shoulder. Even through the armor, you can feel the fleshiness of the enemy's shoulder from your hand. The Craist soldier, panting in pain and spilling his spear, is burned into my eyes. The frightened, exposed emotions that show through his young face and the rigid expression on his face are conveyed through my eyes.</p>

<p>“Oooooooooooooooooo!”</p>

<p>Moyes was not so pure and innocent that he did not know what would happen if he were to twist the spear into his unprotected throat. The memory of his childhood accident tightened his brain on the verge of bursting. He clenched his teeth to the point of shattering. On either side, the soldier wielding the spear, dirty and exhausted, was named Gaston, Evrakh. They have eaten out of the same pot and know each other's backgrounds and food preferences. So do the other platoon members. The more I hesitate, the more they die, the more they suffer.</p>

<p>“Uhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>Moyes poked, his throat cracking as he roared. The fearless sensation transmitted from the hilt, it brought more disgust and rejection than the trauma of his childhood. Still, he did not look away. Without letting out a sound of pain, he watched the soldier drown in blood with his watery breath. Moyes overcame his past memories. It was nothing. He just painted it over with more stimulation.</p>

<p>“Huh, ha, ha, aaaaah.”</p>

<p>His forehead heats up, and he can't feel back and forth. His floating body was drowning on the battlefield. Moyes, scratching algae, crushed the side of the soldier who had been replaced from the second row with his ear with force. The eyeballs, which had just revealed their hostility, lost their color and spun wildly. A further soldier jumps in with a thrust, crossing the shadows of two overlapping corpses.</p>

<p>“シィ゛ぃねぇえ！！”</p>

<p>The thrust, extending from the blind spot, did not allow Moyes any evasive action. Instantly his breath caught in his throat and he felt a dull pain in his ribs. The thrusting spear struck him in the torso, but he slid to the side, chipping away at his armor.</p>

<p>“Nah--”</p>

<p>The confused Craist, unable to hold his ground due to the poor footing, missed the vital point. Before he could think, his feet were moving. Moyes inserts his spear as if he is going to throw himself at it. The spear blade entered through the mandible, slid in, and stopped at the skull, which was as hard as bedrock. A moment later, a piece of wood flies into the void. It was not an external attack. The spear was broken at the base of the spearhead and from the metal clasp due to rough and forceful handling.</p>

<p>Throwing the shredded hilt, Moyes pulls out his longsword. In the nick of time, he pushed back the sword that was approaching above his head. Quickly, he slammed the sword back into the enemy soldier, who covered himself with his shield, from the top. He felt the shield pry open and the flesh tear. It was similar to the feeling of chopping wood cleanly. He unconsciously struck a rhythm and swung his sword down at anyone who caught his eye. Again and again, too many times to count.</p>

<p>"Stop him!</p>

<p>“Don't break the line, fill the hole!”</p>

<p>“Ugh, ah, ah, ah, ah!”</p>

<p>The sound of the loudest screams brought Moyes back to consciousness. The magical membrane loosens, and before he knows it, blood seeps from the skin where he had been cut, and sharp pains run down his arms and cheeks. He caught his breath with his shoulder and looked at his sword blade, which was stained vermilion. I don't even remember how much human blood was on my body. Then he realized. The trembling and tension that had tormented him for so long were gone. I wonder if the imperial knight would laugh at me if I told him that I had become obsessed with killing, which I had hated and avoided so much.</p>

<p>“Keep up with the platoon leader, sir!”</p>

<p>“Don't leave me alone!”</p>

<p>The voices of Gaston and Evrakh, who sounded so determined, made him rush to check the battle line, and he found that he had pushed the enemy into the line, using himself as a starting point. He was pushing the enemy into the line of fire with himself as the starting point. Still, Moyes was a commander in chief. He could not let go of his tenuous initiative and let the enemy's disorganized line of battle fall into place.</p>

<p>"The main force of the enemy is being taken care of by the head instructor!　Don't be defeated by soldiers who are outnumbered."</p>

<p>His voice was strained from the lack of oxygen, but he was lucky not to tremble. This is just a bluff. It was nothing more than a bluff. Even so, a commander's bluff can be a remedy for the soldiers under his command. Moyes took a step forward, as if he were fighting against a raging torrent.</p>

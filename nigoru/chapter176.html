<p>Episode 23</p>

<p>The wood on the bonfire crackled and popped. Shadows, exposed by the setting sun and flames, drift across the walls and ground. Even as the sun was setting, the healers continued their treatment. Some of the injured citizens were on their way home, supported by their families and acquaintances.</p>

<p>Those who remained in the church were those whose wounds had healed but who were still bleeding too much to move. No matter how good a healer or magician he may be, he cannot produce blood. If these were soldiers who could manipulate the magical membrane, also known as a second skin, it would be possible to control the bleeding when injured, but it was too much to ask of ordinary citizens who were not accustomed to rough work.</p>

<p>“Thank you so much for your help.”</p>

<p>It was a middle-aged miner called Oyakata Zidre who bowed deeply. He must be a very loyal person to go around thanking even Walm, who is not a healing magician, on behalf of his ailing friends.</p>

<p>"I'm just standing here. Don't bow so low."</p>

<p>"No way, you rode all night to bring the healer from Celta. If you had been slower, some of them would have been dead or had their rotting limbs chopped off."</p>

<p>Justan was leading the way until the rush, and the poor imperial knight was just clinging to the saddle so he wouldn't be left behind on his inexperienced mount. He had done nothing to earn his gratitude. However, I can't imagine that the miner in front of him would be satisfied if I told him honestly what was going on. Walm stopped denying it and decided to ask a question.</p>

<p>"It was worth the rush. I'd like to know something, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course.</p>

<p>Walm, who had received the master's willing consent, posed a personal question.</p>

<p>"Does the Refn mine have frequent cave-ins of this magnitude?　Or is it a common occurrence in all mines?"</p>

<p>Many prisoners of war and migrant workers who cannot afford to pay the ransom are working in the Carololaira Mythril Mine, which the empire pioneered from the demon territory. They are supervised by mine engineers invited by the former Southern Area Army of the Highserk Empire through Viscount Edgar de Dalimarx. Walm learned this from Friug on his travels. Even Refun, which had one of the largest groups of mine engineers in the north, had suffered a terrible disaster. There was no guarantee that it would not happen even in Carolina, which had a history as young as a baby.</p>

<p>"Well, there are deaths every year, but on a much shorter scale. It's just one passageway, that's all.</p>

<p>It was the rain that did it.</p>

<p>The rivers we had seen on our way to the site had gouged out their banks and were swollen to overflowing everywhere. Even to the untrained eye, this seemed like a suspicious factor.</p>

<p>"It's a rare heavy rain, that's for sure, but it's not the kind of rain that causes one of the main tunnels that holds the drainage tunnels and drainage magicians to collapse. If it were my small tunnel, I would be convinced.</p>

<p>The miner replied with self-deprecation.</p>

<p>“Some unfortunate accident or coincidence.”</p>

<p>"...... Ummm, probably. There were a lot of proud bastards, but I don't think those guys would cut corners in their own hole-in-the-wall. They were disgusting, but they were worth competing with."</p>

<p>The miner still can't believe it. His eyes were fixed on the tunnel behind Walm, where sewage and sediment still poured in.</p>

<p>“At least we can mourn the body, right?”</p>

<p>"Of course. It's a miner's nightmare to wander endlessly through the mine shafts as a ghoul. I don't want that to happen.</p>

<p>"Don't get too worked up. It would be a real disaster if he collapsed and had to be carried here.</p>

<p>“Well, I'll go home and get some sleep so as not to bother the healer-magician.”</p>

<p>I simply watch the man's back, soiled and exhausted. Despite their differences in position, the people were doing their best in their own way. Walm, too, tries to get back to his post as a sentinel, to do his duty. But it was not to be. The sound of multiple, directional footsteps approached. They were the next visitors. Since when did he become a servant responsible for the reception of visitors? I sigh and assess the others.</p>

<p>“Miners, then soldiers...”</p>

<p>Four soldiers of the old Fellian descent showed themselves. When the group from Celta visited Refun, the soldiers stationed in the mining town and the mountain castle had rushed to the city and were working to restore the city. Because of this, their appearance was also noticeable in the vicinity of the treatment center. Although the area was absorbed, it was originally under the power of Ferius. They probably do not have the time to renew all of their remaining armor to their own specifications. Myard's pocketbook situation is also apparent in this situation.</p>

<p>“What do you want?”</p>

<p>The soldier opens his mouth to Walm, who is also warning him not to approach any closer.</p>

<p>"We are a team dispatched from the mountain castle to maintain security in the mining town. I heard that you all came from Celta. You must be tired without rest. As a token of our gratitude, we thought we would at least cooperate with you by keeping watch during the night."</p>

<p>There is certainly a certain laziness that clings to one's body due to lack of rest. Considering his future plans, he was certainly grateful for the offer. Walm checked the soldier from head to toe without moving his gaze, and replied with a broad smile.</p>

<p>“Your concern is deeply felt.”</p>

<p>“So...”</p>

<p>"Yes, but you'll have to wait a bit. I'm not in command here. I'm going to ask the Lord Justan, who is in charge of the guards. I am sure he will be pleased."</p>

<p>Pleasant words to my ears. It's nice to hear someone's kindness. After all, even the Demon Mask trembled with goodwill. In addition, their equipment was clean and free of dirt. Even if they had washed it off just before the attack, it was still too clean. What had they been doing until now?</p>

<p>My thoughts, which should have been exhausted, are now spinning at high speed. Are they simply lazy? Or are they trying to score points for likability? Or is it manipulation or information gathering? Who are they, and what are they carrying in their bellies? Walm turned on his heel inside the room and told Justan, who was in charge of the escort.</p>

<p>"Justan, we have a visitor from the castle outside. It is with great pleasure that I inform you that they will be assisting us in guarding the church hall."</p>

<p>Justan responded by extending his hand and calling out with an exaggerated gesture.</p>

<p>"That's wonderful - then I would like you to stand guard with Lord Walm outside. Inside, as you can see, it's too cramped for just us."</p>

<p>A few words were enough for their mutual respect. The arrival of the target of our vigilance was conveyed in every detail. The ironclad rule of security was to keep anything suspicious away from the building. In addition, the security of the interior was guaranteed by Justin and the cavalry that accompanied him. Walm's role was to make friends with the guests waiting outside.</p>

<p>"Thank you for waiting. I'll have you all join me on patrol outside."</p>

<p>"Of course. I'll leave it to you."</p>

<p>Contrary to Walm, who was trying to take his time and enjoy the exchange, the other party was very impatient. The sound of a quick scrape of cloth tickled my eardrums. It was the last thing I wanted to hear when my attention was drawn to the blind spot, the front of the room.</p>

<p>“Phew?!”</p>

<p>The familiar sound was made when the arm was extended to the opposite hip. What it meant was a drawn sword. A soldier, who had taken advantage of the conversation to flank the soldier, gripped the hilt and was about to draw his sword. Walm, behaving as if asking for a handshake, extended his right arm and grasped the tip of the elbow and held it down. The half-drawn blade of the sword was now stuck in its scabbard, and it went berserk.</p>

<p>“Impatient.”</p>

<p>The imperial knight with a pasted-on smile and the old kingdom soldier with his cheeks twitching were a stark contrast. With the words, the left hand with blue flames in it reaches out and burns the soldier's throat. The blood that spurts out after a slight delay is seared by the blue flame and turns into a blood mist.</p>

<p>“Ahhh, ah!!!”</p>

<p>There is no surprise or protest from the attendant. All that is there are the eyes of determination itself. A voiceless scream was primed. The Ferius soldiers shout as they pull out their prey all at once.</p>

<p>"They've been caught off guard!</p>

<p>"Attack!</p>

<p>The shouts that would be common on the battlefield echoed. There is no sign of agitation. It is not a sudden attack. It was an army attacking according to a clear chain of command.</p>

<p>“Justaan, secure the entrance...oh ！！！！”</p>

<p>Walm grabbed the axe spear that had been propped up and poured magic power into it. A blue flame lit from the hilt to the spearhead, and the leather spear sheath burned and popped. The plan to surprise the enemy had been discovered, and the attack was about to switch to a forceful assault.</p>

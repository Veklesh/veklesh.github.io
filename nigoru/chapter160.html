<p>Episode 7</p>

<p>Walm asks his brother, who is lying on the ground, hoping he has heard him wrong.</p>

<p>"Hey, Hayes, answer me this. Are you still a soldier in Liberitoa?"</p>

<p>"...... Yes, I am. I'm still a Liberitoa soldier."</p>

<p>A not inconsiderable number of Highserk scattered to other countries to escape the Great Outbreak. This remains the case even today, as their homeland is being rebuilt. They overcame discrimination and prejudice, took root in a foreign country, and prepared to bury their bones there. It must have taken a lot of effort and perseverance. Compared to the people who had spent their lives rotting and wasting away in the archipelagic countries, they were positive and productive people. But Walm could not tolerate the country to which his brother had drifted.</p>

<p>“Are you crazy, that Liberitoa?”</p>

<p>The most popular theory of the Great Outbreak was that it was caused by King Ferius' desperation to self-destruct. It is also said that it was a plot by the allies and led by Liberitoa, but the truth is not yet clear. At least, Walm, the head of the team-sized personnel, would have no way of knowing. Still, there is a clear fact. Liberitoa is one of the four countries in the alliance that is said to be the cause of the tipping point, and it is a country that still wants Highserk to bow down.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm perfectly sane ...... Walm, the reason I was looking for you was to get you to live in Liberitoa. Unlike before, I can at least provide for my brother. If you want, I can find you a job outside of the rough stuff. You don't have to serve in the military anymore."</p>

<p>If it had been said by a stranger from Liberitoa, it would have seemed like a provocation to provoke the Highserk soldier into a rage. But the brother in front of him is speaking with good intentions, the opposite of malice. The quality is even worse. I can't help it, and my uncontrollable anger just swells.</p>

<p>"I am. I knew what happened to my father and mother. Back in the ...... village, I killed my undead parents with my own hands. I burned not only my family, but also my neighbors. I still remember it. How could I forget? So why is my brother a soldier under the original villain?</p>

<p>"...... Walm must have buried him. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry."</p>

<p>My brother must be truly sorry. The fists clenched tightly made a grinding sound and the nails dug into the skin. Hayes, who had uttered his regrets and apologies to Walm, who had let his emotions get the better of him, began to explain under his breath.</p>

<p>"I fled to Liberitoa and became a soldier because I thought my country had been destroyed. The army was in total collapse in the west, and as far as I was concerned, I could not offer any resistance to the avalanche of demons. There was no room for doubt. And Liberitoa was the only place where they could escape to their deaths. There was no place to return to, no family to go back to. There is only limited work for those who have been forced to flee their country. I had no other choice. If I had hesitated, if I had been confused, I would have died."</p>

<p>Walm, who knew about the retreat from Dandurg and the devastation leading up to the imperial capital, had no way to deny it. Then Walm realized one fact. Jaff's cavalry battalion had lured part of the Great Outbreak into the Liberitoa Trade Federation. They substituted Liberitoa's forces for the missing frontal forces. Militarily speaking, this was a wise decision. Given a reprieve, Highserk evacuated its human resources to the south and east, which became the foundation for its later rebuilding. It was probably a necessary operation. But what would have happened to the West and the North, including the homeland that was the lure for the Great Outbreak, is clearer than fire. Now only dark thoughts come to mind.</p>

<p>"Hayes, let's go back to Highserk. We can still start over."</p>

<p>Walm admonished his brother, suppressing the swirling emotions he was unable to sort out.</p>

<p>"I sincerely wish I could. If only it had been a year and a half earlier. Now, I can't do it anymore--I have a family. I'm a Liberitoa wife. I have two children. I can't go back. I can't go back. I'm Liberitoa now."</p>

<p>Hayes said, his face contorting bitterly. The marriage and the presence of nephews and nieces, which should have been a joyous occasion, have added to the complexity of the situation. That adds to the complexity of the situation. Walm finally understood that his brother was suffering and conflicted between his Liberitoa and Highserk families.</p>

<p>"They may be the source. I'm also repulsed by those who caused the Great Outbreak. Still, it was Liberitoa soldiers who saved me when I should have been dead, and they accepted a stranger, an enemy of the country for that matter. I even have a comrade-in-arms whom I can trust with my back as we work to chip away at the demon territory. I don't want to fight with my brothers. If Liberitoa is not possible, another country is fine. Please, stay away from Highserk."</p>

<p>"Hayes, I can't. I can't do that."</p>

<p>Walm bites his lip in denial, but his brother continues to persuade him.</p>

<p>"Think about the difference in national power. Besides, this isn't like the Sarajevo fortress battle. Unlike the expedition with its stretched logistics, Liberitoa can pour its full strength into Highserk. The remaining garrisons along the border will also be deployed. How many soldiers can Highserk afford to send out now? Liberitoa, with some Felians and Highserk who have gone into exile, can raise a force of more than 40,000 to 50,000 men."</p>

<p>Still, when Walm did not shake his head or say a word, his brother's words grew stronger.</p>

<p>"The experience and lessons learned from the Great Outbreak and the Four-Party Alliance battles have filled the gap in skill levels, and the gap in troop strength has only widened. Are you going to die a martyr to your nation!　You have done enough. Liberitoa's bad points will stand out, too. But, hey, I'm not thoroughly heartless. There may be some calculation, but this is how they accept me and even other former Highserkers."</p>

<p>Walm, who had remained silent, revealed his true feelings.</p>

<p>"It's true, if we get into an all-out war with Liberitoa, our chances of winning are slim. We might die. I don't want to die willingly, either."</p>

<p>“Then--”</p>

<p>"Then there's also the fact that you can't abandon the community, the country, you know. More than that, I can't leave my comrades-in-arms and the people who still believe in my country. I'm a knight in disguise, but I'm still a knight. Besides. What did those men die for in Sarajevo, in Dandurg? What were they sacrificed for? I don't want them to die in vain. Highserk is not a good country. The land is poor, the food is bad and scarce. There is even military service. There was organized plunder in the enemy country. They must have made many terrible mistakes. Still, it is human beings who learn from past mistakes, move on, and mature. I don't want to give up without doing anything."</p>

<p>Walm wished that on that day when the country fell, on a hill overlooking the imperial capital. Without looking away, he conveyed his thoughts to his brother. When Hayes' shoulders slumped at the parallel between the two men, he shook his head and said, "Why is this happening to me?</p>

<p>“I don't know why I'm like this.”</p>

<p>Walm feels the same way. If he could, he would have laughed innocently with his siblings and family as he did when he was a child.</p>

<p>"I wonder why, really. I don't know if today is the last time. Maybe we will see each other again. But I wouldn't want to see them if they were enemies."</p>

<p>Hayes stopped Walm as he stood up.</p>

<p>“Wait, I'm not done talking to you!”</p>

<p>Haze yells at him, and Walm frowns in annoyance. He even shook his head in response to his passion.</p>

<p>"What are we going to do? The environment, the situation, we can't come to terms with each other. We can't come to terms with each other because of the environment, the circumstances, and we can't come to terms with each other. I was happy just to be alive and reunited with him like this. I'm not running away. I'm not going to run away, I'm going to be alone for a while, and I'm going to cool down.</p>

<p>I don't want to argue with my siblings. Walm was going to leave the place for a while to cool down. A cooler head might be able to come up with a better idea. Before he could finish his words as he moved away, Hayes, who had been looking away, interrupted him with an angry shout, not unlike an older brother.</p>

<p>"That's--uh, stop it!　Walm, get out."</p>

<p>The bloodshot eyes, the urgent voice, and the disconnected conversation, as if in the middle of a battlefield. Walm, sensing something wrong with Hayes' shouts, frowned and belatedly realized what was happening. He had not called out to his brother. It would be unreasonable to say that he had been distracted. Walm's emotions were so shaken that he was devoting most of his attention to his brother. The swelling murderous atmosphere and magical power had been carefully prepared and concealed. Surrounding them was a group of Liberitoa soldiers who were not supposed to be there.</p>

<p>"What?</p>

<p>The Liberitoa soldiers, having thrown off their disguise, attacked with frightening speed. The older brother rushed out and reached for his younger brother, but this only served as priming, as a dizzying rush of attack magic poured in. The torrent of magic turned into an unmanageable pain that mercilessly engulfed Walm.</p>

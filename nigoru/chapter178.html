<p>Episode 25</p>

<p>One of the army members who was the first to break away from the fleeing crowd, moves ahead of Walm. It was a poor plan from the standpoint of footing, but in fact, it was neither reckless nor heroic. It was a wise decision to be wary of the fire magic that had wiped out the archers. The battle strategy of the anti-magic soldiers is limited to thinness and first move.</p>

<p>“OHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>The spearmen raised their short spears and struck down from the upper level, without weakening the momentum of the rushing battle. The spear, the handle of which flexed and roared with a wind-swishing sound, was aimed at Cervellia. Even though his helmet prevented the slash, the impact easily cracked his skull. He was probably planning to force her to evade by slamming down, and to keep pace with her by thrusting mainly. The advantage of the spear is its lightness. The speed of the thrust, which is delivered without a pause, is unmatched by other melee weapons. The lightness of the blow that accompanies the bare spear can also be compensated for by the downing of the spear.</p>

<p>Considering the followers, it is necessary to reduce the number of the followers. Avoiding a leisurely reading contest, Walm sat back and swung his axe spear. The axe spear, equipped with a branch blade and axe head, is extremely heavy. When he had just switched weapons, the weight of the spear gave him a hard time, but among the weapons in his possession, it has been with him longer than the Demon Mask.</p>

<p>The tip of the spear turned from its ground-crawling trajectory and aimed at the sky. The two crossed spears fought each other. The spearman's elbows were bounced over his head, along with the spear that had been pushed away from him. Walm, following the inertia of the axe and spear, spun around on his ankles, his hips spinning like a spinning top. The spearman, blindingly astonished, stretched out his elbows to create a space between the spear and his body. It was a defense that was based on stick fighting, but it didn't matter any more.</p>

<p>“Uh, oh, ah!”</p>

<p>The axe-spear, clad in magic power, folded its hilt like a twig, carving a single letter wound into the armor. The spearman collapsed to his knees and plunged down as if in penitence. Delayed, sticky blood pours out around him. His gut is severed, and although his armor prevents his guts from seeping out, how much meaning is left after his instant death?</p>

<p>"Don't be cowed. Attack!"</p>

<p>The soldiers and blades, sacrificing the skilled soldiers who had preceded them, were massed into a single mass, and the blades were closing in. Interception on the spot would be defeated by the difference in the number of hands. The magic power was mixed into a messy mixture, and without hesitation, it was launched right in front of their eyes. The fierce flames covered the corpses of the imperial knights and spearmen, turning the field of vision blue. Even though it was a make-believe threat with little time to knead the magic, the flash and heat were unmistakably real. Some people stopped to stop from one of the primal fears of flames, others protected their vital points with their hands, but in front of the 《Demon Fire》 user, it was a fatal upset.</p>

<p>The only one who tried to assess the situation, squinting at the searing heat in his eyeballs, was out of luck. For the most military value had been enchanted by Walm. When he felt the blue flame waver, a hole was drilled in his throat. The demon mask, bathed in fresh blood, laughed and snickered in a tipsy manner. By the time the soldiers on either side perceive the thrust as a stab from the flames, one has had his neck shaved by a drawn-back branch blade, and a second thrust agitates another soldier's eye socket.</p>

<p>“In the fire!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>With a shout, the side cleave of the war hammer scrapes through the flames, but Walm slips between the two remaining men, leaning forward like a skalengeck running on the ground. One of the soldiers slammed his longsword down to split the knight, but the illusion of the blue flames threw off the sense of distance. The sharp tip of the sword only stroked the void as it traced the body that was being scraped through. We cannot let them take our backs without a moment's hesitation. One of the soldiers who tried to turn around fell on his buttocks.</p>

<p>“Hurry up and stand up!”</p>

<p>The hammerman, frustrated and reprimanded, was at a loss for words when he saw the devastation of his comrade crawling on the ground. Walm was picking them off with a branch blade from the tendons of their knees to their thighs as he passed them by.</p>

<p>“Phew, phew!”</p>

<p>Walm gives the topmost answer to the swaying war hammer user, whether to support his comrade-in-arms or eliminate the threat. With a short exhale, the accelerating axe head slashed past his shoulder and into his side, allowing no resistance. He falls on top of his companion, who crawls on the ground in a covered position. The soldier attempts to stand up, repelling the corpse, but falls again.</p>

<p>The laceration reached the arteries. It would have been possible to prolong his life if he had been held down with a magical membrane before he lost too much blood, but the source of life was already flowing too fast. With a gasping breath, he clutched the soil and became motionless. Walm had a hand on him, but there was no time to nurse him back to health. Many of the attackers still remained.</p>

<p>"What the hell is that guy?</p>

<p>"Don't take him seriously!　Restrain him first!</p>

<p>While more men are assigned to Walm, the enemy commander tells his men to stall.</p>

<p>“Knock down the armored doors!!!!”</p>

<p>"Don't let them escape. Don't let them escape, and secure the back entrance."</p>

<p>Apart from the front entrance, which Walm was in charge of, orders were given one after another. Walm had assumed that the commander was among the advance guard, but he was wrong. Five additional men were sent to the underworld, but the chain of command was sound. The command structure was sound.</p>

<p>"Hook me on a limb!</p>

<p>Don't cut each other, keep your distance!</p>

<p>The assailants were trying to avoid getting too deep into the knight. Mixed in with the mayhem is the sound of dull blows. It is clearly not the sound of hitting a person. The uninvited guest was roughly knocking on the armored door with a large mallet. Out of the corner of one's eye, the hammer head, guided by centrifugal force, catches the center of the armored door and eats away at the pieces of wood. The rhythmic crushing sound continued to echo. The damned marauders compensated for the difference in skill level with their numbers and distance. I couldn't just turn my back and leave.</p>

<p>“Just a few more whacks, and--geez!”</p>

<p>A scream followed after a more rasping sound of destruction. A shadow stretched out through a gap in the distorted armored door. It was the short spear of the accompanying cavalryman. The spear tip gouged through the armpit, a weak point in the armor's structure, and reached the chest. There was no need to examine it. It was a fatal wound.</p>

<p>“Oooh, hey, they're waiting for you.”</p>

<p>“Push back, push through!”</p>

<p>The old Ferius soldiers, who were counterattacked by the shells that were supposed to be caged in their shells, did not hide their fury and thrust their maces and swords back into the gap, but the results were not good. The attack and defense through the armored door intensified and continued unceasingly.</p>

<p>“Huh, hah--haha.”</p>

<p>He continues to move like running water, exhaling finely. Walm also shifted from fighting to bury with a single blow, following in the footsteps of the enemy soldiers, to a precise limb-shredding movement. From the tip of the ear to the branch blade, axe head, and stone thrust, there is no part of the body that he does not make full use of. He changes hands, thrusting, striking, hooking, and slashing without being noticed. The axe spear was colored with miscellaneous flesh and blood. Demon Masks brown the loose skewers.</p>

<p>“If you won't help, shut up.”</p>

<p>Cursing with a breath you don't want to take, it becomes a petty annoyance. Walm was fed up with the uncaring side, but so were the assailants. Not Demon Mask, to be precise, but the individual imperial knights.</p>

<p>“You should have just gone crazy on me!”</p>

<p>As if to limit the space, the assailant pretends to cling to the door. Walm, unable to ignore it, has to deal with it with a nervousness. Demon Masks are the only ones who would be happy to burn down an urban area. It's no laughing matter if you burn the target of your escort in the first place.</p>

<p>"This way!</p>

<p>I'm going to blow the door off!"</p>

<p>Walm inwardly clucked his tongue at the new hand that was called to him. The magic power that was rising to this spectacular level was a precursor to offensive magic. Even though they are escorted, the precious mage soldiers are on their way out. Their aim is both Walm and the door. At any rate, they are calling out to us to try to avoid them. Considering that the clinging mundanes do not evacuate, an earth bullet, or - before I could finish turning my thoughts - a magic projectile.</p>

<p>It was an ice spear, a semi-transparent and substantial attack magic with a water attribute. Walm retracted his axe spear, smashing the fingers of the soldier who was greedy for an opportunity with a stone thrust. The vanguard's restraints are loosened if they really don't want to get involved. He glances at the flying ice spear with his magic eye and greets it with his axe spear. He had no intention of engaging in a contest of strength. The shock hits my hand, but my fingers continue to hold the hilt. The axe head, while scraping the surface of the ice, changed the angle of the ice spear. The ice spear pierced the outer wall without hitting the imperial knight or the door.</p>

<p>“Woah, he slashed it.”</p>

<p>“...... next, keep going!”</p>

<p>Walm smiled behind his mask. In a killing match, the one who is frightened loses. The commander, who had been calmly giving orders, was clearly dismayed in front of his men. It would be a terrible mud fight, but he was originally a knight from the earthy peasantry. He was accustomed to fighting in the mud.</p>

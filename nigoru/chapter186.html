<p>Episode 33</p>

<p>"The Myard faction's Refun garrison is stuck in a landslide, isn't it? What's the point of protecting a place like this?"</p>

<p>A man sitting slumped on a stump lamented the meaning of his existence. He was not being thoughtful. Soldiers are notified in advance of the reason for their deployment. The truth of the matter is that it's just a blur.</p>

<p>"A small number of soldiers can pass through old roads and animal trails. This is one of them."</p>

<p>Iasant, the chief of the ten, answered the question of the soldiers who were formally under his command. The selection of a soldier as a head of ten was not based on his combat experience or his skillful control of the men. It was only that he had a better head among the people who were drafted by the Yarukkuk lords. Therefore, inexperienced Iasant was not respected by the soldiers, and a strict hierarchy was not established in the Ten.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what Iasanto said, 'Even a fool wouldn't get through. There's a barrier ahead. If anything goes wrong, the lord's soldiers will be right there."</p>

<p>“Well, yes.”</p>

<p>No one would go to the trouble of going through a barrier, even if they were a messenger of some sort. The front toothless fool is probably not wrong. The question is the role of the troops. A fugitive from Celta or a lone messenger could easily be handled by a ten-man squad. What should be a cause for concern was an attack of more than a platoon size. Iasant and his men were, at best, outposts, and at worst, birds in the mine.</p>

<p>Their role was to warn the rear of danger with the twitter of battle. Their physical strength and equipment were inadequate, and even the horse barriers that blocked the paths were hastily constructed and shabby. Those who are truly needed are stationed at the barrier where Iasanto's ten-man team has set up a temporary checkpoint.</p>

<p>“If you're assigned to the Celta area, you'll get some perks.”</p>

<p>Rolling his spear on the ground, the soldier, now out of his depth, crunches dried beans with his back teeth. Chewing one by one, he looked like a bird. But it was not a cute little bird, but a monstrous bird.</p>

<p>Don't talk so big. You were in a panic when you were drafted."</p>

<p>His appearance and tone of voice made him unpopular among his peers, and he was laughed out of the room. Iasant did not defend him.</p>

<p>"Nah. No one would have thought that the Lords would have turned on Craist."</p>

<p>“It's better than sticking with Myard, who's fallen.”</p>

<p>Celta's people were too busy talking about distribution.</p>

<p>“Well, I can understand if the lords are hoarding, but I don't give a damn about the bellies of strangers.”</p>

<p>Toothless are not particularly wicked. It is natural to put family and neighbors before strangers. That's how people live, big or small. Iasant is no exception. The lord also put the prosperity of the Yalıkıkı territory first.</p>

<p>“But it's a turnover.”</p>

<p>“If turning over makes your life richer, you can turn over as many as you want.”</p>

<p>“We're dealing with weak soldiers from Myard anyway.”</p>

<p>The other soldiers agree with him. The chief of the ten was more concerned about his enemies than the morality of not having a belly. Iasant mentions the name.</p>

<p>“But there are Highserk soldiers there, too.”</p>

<p>With a single word, the loose air is heavily transformed. To the Felians, the word Highserk was both an abomination and an object of awe. It was insane to fight through a war against most of the northern nations. If they had any reason left, they would have chosen to compromise and prioritize the survival of their nation once an allied force was formed. And yet, they relied solely on force to solve the problem. For Iassant, they were incomprehensible.</p>

<p>"The Highserk men belong to Celta, don't they?</p>

<p>“Well, the Royal Army of Craist will confront them.”</p>

<p>“Hee hee, you're a worrier, Iasanto Jyuninchou-sama.”</p>

<p>As if to hide the fact that he was right, the toothless man declared that he was the “Ten Chiefs,” whom he usually does not even call. Iasanto could not remain silent at this blatant insinuation.</p>

<p>"Hey, don't take advantage of me. I'll lose all your back teeth too.</p>

<p>"Hey, hey. Don't get mad at me!</p>

<p>Toothless blinks in astonishment. This guy is petty at heart, but vain at the same time. I don't know if he's this surprised just because Iasanto packed it in... Fortunately or unfortunately, the answer to his question came immediately. The answer to this question came immediately. The necks and torsos of the two soldiers who had been trotted out suddenly cried out and parted.</p>

<p>“What?!”</p>

<p>Iasant couldn't believe his eyes, but the reality was unmistakable. At the center of the blood-dripping carnage, a monster wearing a Demon Mask twists itself with a spear. It is no ordinary spear. It was an axe spear with an axe head and claws on its side. Wielding the massive spearhead like a twig, it raised the axe spear with a flicker of magic power, as if it were mowing the wheat.</p>

<p>“Hyu, gee!”</p>

<p>The axe-head slices off an armful of short spears held at an angle, cutting another soldier in two, from the lower abdomen to the tip of the chin. It was a fatal wound through the armor, albeit a crude one, a technique accomplished by the 《Hard Strike》, which cuts down on reason.</p>

<p>“Whoaaaaah!!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>In the face of impending death, Toothless reached for the spear he had rolled to the ground, but it was too slow. The clawed side blade, carelessly thrust out, picked at his throat. What the hell is this guy, he's not kidding. Iasanto, without raising his voice, thrusts out a short spear held at his hip bone.</p>

<p>Without averting his eyes, he bites into the spear as if to hit it with his entire body. Iasanth, who had abandoned his evil intentions and clung to his training, reversed as if the monster had anticipated this. As if to say, "I've saved you the trouble.</p>

<p>“Ooooh!”</p>

<p>The spear magically scraped away. The shortest stab - my intuition told me that I was going to die. Quickly, he tried to relax his fear of death with a yell, but the shock to the side of his head would not allow even that. Iasanth fell to the ground, and in his agitated vision, he saw.</p>

<p>There were two other enemies besides the soldier wearing the Demon Mask. Ironically, Iasanto, who had been hit in the side of the head by a spear, was the only one in the ten-man squad who was still breathing. How long would that last? His body, trampled by the soles of his shoes, was bound to the ground, and a sharp blade was attached to his neck. I was sure. If he moved an inch, he would be killed.</p>

<p>"Hey, Walm. You're going to kill them all."</p>

<p>"...... sorry. I almost killed them out of reflex."</p>

<p>“That's why Highserk people are like this.”</p>

<p>The attackers continue their conversation without incident, even though they are surrounded by fresh corpses right after killing each other. Like a small talk on the side of the road. I resented the toothless ones who had gone before me. What's the matter with you, there are no Highserk soldiers here? The most troublesome Demon Fire user is right in front of us. Iasant, who was left with life and death in his hands, had no choice but to lament inwardly.</p>

<p>The little bird in the mine called “Iasant 10-man squadron” dies in silence. The danger was never made known to his friends.</p>

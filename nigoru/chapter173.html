<p>Episode 20</p>

<p>The room was very cramped in contrast to the vastness of the castle. It was a small room with no furnishings and not even a window. All that existed was a dimly lit lamp, a pair of chairs, and a desk. If two people were to enter such a place, they would naturally end up facing each other. Gran, the leader of the Knights of Reharzen, was accustomed to such a small room. It was the perfect place for secret talks as long as one did not mind the appearance.</p>

<p>“Don't give me a hard time without rest as soon as you return from the front line.”</p>

<p>Chester Craist, the main man of Gran, and the person with whom I was having the secret talk, said a word of thanks.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your kind words, they mean a lot to me. However, this is a room I have been familiar with for a long time. It is like my own room compared to the old Ferius and Demon Territory."</p>

<p>The Kingdom of Craist, which absorbed the country's former territories and personnel after the collapse of the Kingdom of Ferius, has become the largest landmass and national power since its founding. Sounds good. But in reality, it is nothing more than an inflated figurehead. No matter how much devastated land it has acquired and how many refugees it has, it is hard to say that it has strong flesh and blood. Craist, which could only boast of its elite few, had suddenly emerged as the leader of the northern countries, and this was its downside.</p>

<p>It lacked a head to manage the regions, generals to be the hands and feet, and civilian officials to be the blood. He had the manpower, but not the manpower. Therefore, Gran, who was only the head of one knighthood, had to take on multiple roles to make ends meet. If only time permitted, the food of FELIUS would be fleshed out, but there was no time left for that.</p>

<p>"Oh well. It's such a dusty place. Let's skip the formalities and talk. Ayane did not respond to repeated requests to return, and remained in Celta. Moreover, Myard is connected to Highserk and clearly refuses to join the forces of the Kingdom of Craist. The Grand Duchess, who is so dismayed, is being very resolute, is she not?"</p>

<p>Highserk had been beaten and defeated in the previous war. But he was unstoppable. Now Myard, likewise, had taken too long. The shameful feeling of not knowing what to do remains in Gran's mind.</p>

<p>"You don't know this yet, but there was a troop reinforcement from Varigend to Celta. It is on the scale of two and a half hundred men - accompanied by a Demon Fire user."</p>

<p>“Is it the abominable ”luring fire of the underworld“ that burned the Alliance in the Curve Group?”</p>

<p>The fearsome enemy that, clad in blue flames, burned the positions of the four nations' alliances on the eve of the Great Offensive. If he had relied solely on powerful skills and magic, there would have been an opening to take advantage of him, but his battle techniques, accumulated through actual combat, are at the level of a master. What shook Gran more than anything else was his extraordinary mentality. After his unit was destroyed, he went into hiding for five days in a circle that had been turned into a mass grave. With his maggoty comrade-in-arms by his side.</p>

<p>"I wish I had fallen into the underworld with Gerald. It would have been troublesome."</p>

<p>Gran's face contorted bitterly. He was the very factor that set back the capture of Sarajevo Fortress and caused the loss of Ayane, the key healing magician. The ghost of the man who was supposed to have been killed in the Great Outbreak had risen from the underworld.</p>

<p>"Having experienced defeat, Highserk has changed dramatically. More flexible, more efficient. They act as allies, even with their enemies, without regard to tradition or faction. Highserk, which used to be a punching bag, has changed."</p>

<p>Even within the harsh northern countries, the region that became the predecessor to Highserk was a unique anathema. The blood never dried as they fought over the few remaining breadbasket areas. They could have fought over the land forever, but Highserk, having united the region, turned its attention to the neighboring countries. They declared. Highserk said that they were only fighting a war to defend their homeland, and that they were just paying the price for the fire that was raining down on them. In reality, they were a nation that liked to be beaten, and once they got together, they were an intolerable nation that would crush and chew you to the bone. But now. Now, it seeks accommodation with other countries and even deploys troops to defend friendly countries.</p>

<p>If the empire that was beaten down had come to its senses, Gran would not be as impatient as he is now. The problem is that the essence of that country remains, a lonely hungry wolf that has learned to pack and share its food. But the hungry wolf remains hungry and hates the one who intercepted its food. If they were to regain their former strength, the two countries would have one destination in mind, with the Carololian Mythril Mine and the Refun Mine in their possession.</p>

<p>"This is a venerable situation. What awaits us in the not-too-distant future is a war that will split the northern countries in two."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Liberitoa has finally made its decision. It seems that the battle for control of the Federal Council has been regained by the main faction led by Foreign Minister Hugo. The reason is that the national policy is to have a cohesive federal system, including factional fighting."</p>

<p>Chester laments the state of the Confederation. A federation built on the foundations of several small and medium-sized countries inevitably takes time to unify its decision-making process. This is a clear weakness of the Liberitoa Trade Federation. Liberitoa's moderates did not resort to military force, and they achieved some success in capturing the remnants of Highserk. But at the same time, they were scheming and gave the empire time to rise to its feet.</p>

<p>"Myard's little girl, on the other hand, either had a good backer or had grown up in such a short period of time that she became a troublesome opponent. His ability to take over the Ferius territory after the Great Outbreak was swift, and his subjects' evaluations of him were not bad. Even if he wanted to replace his head, security was tight. Even if they were to poison him, Ayane would still be there. It's pointless. ...... I've been turning a blind eye to it because of its rare ability, but we can no longer leave it alone under these circumstances."</p>

<p>Gran correctly recognized the meaning behind the words, "Put a hard line into consideration.</p>

<p>“You have not obeyed me before, and you will not comply now.”</p>

<p>“Or send you back home to complain of your childhood friend's illness.”</p>

<p>"The otherworlders are also lenient with their own people. But they are distrustful of us, and the female Grand Duke has put them in our place. I wonder if they will obey him honestly."</p>

<p>"...... There is no grace. We will have to lure them out and ask them to leave before the war starts."</p>

<p>Chester tapped his desk. He was being urged by his own lord to come up with a plan. A clear bait was needed, one that could not be meddled with in a solid den. Fortunately, he had no shortage of collaborators, and the groundwork was complete.</p>

<p>"Myard is not a monolith either. Many are antagonistic to the idea of being associated with an old enemy. The legacy of Felius is sweet, but it is also deadly poison. As I told you before, the preparation is done. Ayane has healed too many people, for better or worse. It was also easy to make contact with some church forces that have healing magicians."</p>

<p>Good, a voice echoed in the closed room. Chester nodded in satisfaction after receiving Gran's report.</p>

<p>"Although we have gone through several deadly lines, Youto is still naive and unstable. However, Makoto understands the situation well. When three people get together, factions are inevitably born. When it comes to men and women, love and hate await. If it's between them, they will respond."</p>

<p>"It is really hard to deal with those who are uneven in mind, body, and spirit. So what about Johanna?"</p>

<p>Gran admitted that he had hit a sore spot.</p>

<p>"He's one of them. Like Maia, he gets too deep into the bonded and otherworldly people. I think I spoiled him a little too much."</p>

<p>“Even you, the ruthless one?”</p>

<p>"I am human, too. I can also show a little compassion."</p>

<p>The way he said it made the Lord laugh. After a slight stammer, Chester gave instructions to Gran in a flat voice.</p>

<p>"The timing is discretionary. Johanna and Youto should be deployed to another front. The demon territory on the coastline would be good."</p>

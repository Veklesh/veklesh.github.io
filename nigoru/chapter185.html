<p>Episode 32</p>

<p>Temporary peace was shattered. The land of man, which had been recaptured from demons, was now taken by the same human species. The burial of private armies by the Kingdom of Craist's army temporarily disabled key points, and the opening was enough for the avalanche of large armies. After several clashes, the provisional border garrison loses organized resistance and the line of defense collapses. The end of the people who lost their defenders was always terrible. Those who remained in their villages were subjected to the hungry malice of thousands and devoured by the army like locusts.</p>

<p>One family of former Felician farmers, who narrowly escaped the militia's overtures, has been one of the lucky ones so far. While many of those who survived the Great Outbreak lost their families and were dispersed, three generations of parents and children slipped into Celta, and their lives were spared. The village that had been their home had been turned into a demon territory, but it was returned to human hands by pioneer soldiers, and the farmer settled with his family.</p>

<p>When the wheat seeds he had escaped with sprouted and were harvested after much hard work, he loved them like his own children. The farmer was running away again, taking the wheat seed and his family with him. After passing through a slope that seemed to go on forever, forests surrounded both sides of the road. The highly dangerous demons had been swept away, but the ones that were left behind were lured by the noise and crept up on us. In fact, there was a blood trail where something had been dragged deep into the gloomy forest.</p>

<p>The family had already walked all night. They were all pale with a feeling of fatigue that clung to them. Realizing his limits, the farmer stopped temporarily for a short rest. His wife applied herbs to the feet of the children, who were in pain. The big toe and heel are red and bleeding. The repeated rubbing had resulted in a terrible flesh sting.</p>

<p>“Do you want to ride on my back?”</p>

<p>“No, I'm fine.”</p>

<p>The farmer called out to his second son, who shook his head and refused. The gentle concern of his own child, who was not yet ten, was just painful now.</p>

<p>"Don't be shy. Unlike Grandpa, Dad's fine."</p>

<p>After patting his child on the head, the man crouches down. What parent wouldn't be able to carry a child or two on his back?</p>

<p>“That's nice.”</p>

<p>“It's your turn.”</p>

<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>I smile at my child, who looks at his siblings enviously, and my eldest son shouts happily. Maybe we'll make it to Celta. The farmer's modest wish was squashed by reality. It was distant, snatched, but certainly audible.</p>

<p>“......”</p>

<p>The surroundings also noticed something unusual. The sparse line of people grew faster and faster. The man's family was no exception. Then the exclamation of someone unseen announced the situation.</p>

<p>“It's Craist's militia!”</p>

<p>The line of refugees begins to move in a frenzy. They all continue to run with all their hearts, but the ones with the least amount of strength left are the first to fall. Many give up the road and flee into the forest. Men continue to run with their children in their arms. An elderly father and his wife run hard, panting for breath, but their lungs are rumbling and their legs are stiffening like sticks from exhaustion.</p>

<p>The screams are coming. Looking back, he saw spears fired by Craist militiamen, nearly laying waste to a family that had turned off the road and tried to flee. Light infantrymen ahead of them were killing refugees at random. What to do. We could run into the woods - but we would not be able to escape to Celta. It is not only the demons that are waiting for us. The mountain hunts against the defeated soldiers and civilians continued to intensify. I could not choose a slow death.</p>

<p>“Why, why, we are the same Ferius people.”</p>

<p>“My legs can't run anymore.”</p>

<p>The lamentations were drowned out by the shouts and screams. I wondered if the neighbors who had been swallowed by the Great Outbreak had also met their demise like this. The mainstay who must protect his family is pitiful. Fear lifts the sickle and reveals the man's cowardice.</p>

<p>“Grandpa, I'm going to kick the crap out of those guys.”</p>

<p>“Father-in-law!”</p>

<p>The farmer could not believe his ears at the sound of his father's voice. The old man, his spine bent, pulls out a shortsword, an heirloom he had carried with him on his return from the war.</p>

<p>“Dad, that's--!”</p>

<p>Although it was never spoken of by him, people knew that the man's father had been in skirmishes with demons and people in his military service. He was proud of his father as a great man who did his duty. Still, he was reckless. There was no way he could beat an active soldier in full armor.</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth, you stupid bastard. Don't look back, don't ever look back."</p>

<p>Despite his strong tone, he gently patted my head. Memories of my childhood come back to me. His eyes were filled with the same steely determination as when the man's mother died of an epidemic. When his father returned from his tour of duty, he hugged him and repeatedly stroked him, saying, "I will raise you well even if I have to do it alone. My father, who had just returned from his tour of duty, hugged me and repeatedly stroked me, saying, "I'm going to raise you well, even if you're on your own. I was speechless.</p>

<p>"Hey, grandpa!</p>

<p>“Hey, look forward, run along.”</p>

<p>In a trembling voice, the farmer admonished the child. Crying would only make his breathing more erratic. A cowering metallic sound was followed by a dry thud, as if a burlap sack had been slammed down. The family did not look back, as promised. The impending battle cry receded slightly. But, ruthlessly, it was only temporary. He knew nothing about warfare, but he was certain. If he continued at this rate, they would catch up with him. My father died without a single scream. What did he die for--did he die a dog's death?</p>

<p>His little hands trembled, and the child he carried on his back was breathing unevenly from the strain. For the farmer, it carries an irreplaceable weight. That's why I understood my late father's feelings so well that they tore at me.</p>

<p>“...... I'll be next.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, you, you!”</p>

<p>His children clung to him as if they would never let him go, and his wife broke down crying and stilled. The man's resolve grew stronger.</p>

<p>“Run to Celta, and be well.”</p>

<p>The man shook off his family and handed over the wheat seed and faced his impending death. With trembling fingers, he pulled out a dagger. How small compared to the long spear pointed at me. My throat choked, tears streaming from the flood of emotions pressing down on my respiratory tract.</p>

<p>“Hmph, hmph, hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.”</p>

<p>The old father fought without a single sound to keep the family from turning around. Yet the farmer's voice leaked out pitifully. A swarm of reddish-black tips of the ear loomed over them. They looked like countless branches that had sucked blood. Finally, even their physiognomy was clearly visible. In contrast to their sneers, the farmer gritted his teeth. He could not handle a weapon. Still, the man was determined. Even if he dies, he will hang on to him even after death.</p>

<p>The people were being chased back.</p>

<p>The people are hit in the back and fall to the ground, coughing up blood. The militiamen look very familiar: it's easier to stay put when the plunderers don't move. They don't have to run away or hide their belongings. Friug sees an old man bravely challenging such a hungry, blood-filled, and inebriated group.</p>

<p>“Captain!”</p>

<p>Quietly, yet clearly, the soldiers under his command call out for a signal.</p>

<p>"Not yet, it's too far. Besides, if you interrupt now, it will be the people of Myard who will be crushed to death."</p>

<p>Sacrificing a few is acceptable to save the many. Half-hearted intervention only leads to more casualties. It is not a pleasant feeling, even though I understand it. Many of those who experienced the battle at Dandurg owe a debt of gratitude, large or small, to the Duchy of Myard.</p>

<p>The old man was a masterful swordsman, his swordsmanship so sharp that it was hard to believe he had a crooked back. The old man crushed several spearheads and stopped a group of men in their tracks, if only temporarily. But the price to pay was life. The very beings he had risked his life to protect were now in danger. Friug was not alone. Experienced soldiers were also getting impatient. Those who had lost their families and hometowns on the mainland had grown fond of their new home in Myard as they depended on Celta for food and clothing.</p>

<p>As a soldier, Friug detached himself from his emotions and just waited for the right moment. But as a mere human being, his emotions cry out. Don't give up, run, a little more, faster, a little more. Following the lead of the old man, another farmer flips. In his hand is a small dagger. The Craist militiamen were at the mercy of the old man and were in a murderous rage. He tried to pierce the man with an array of spears to relieve his earlier sorrow.</p>

<p>The farmer was so dismayed that he could see it from a distance. It was easy to sneer at him, but how many soldiers could do the same thing, standing in front of a bed of spears? Friug ordered. It was slightly faster and more abrasive than usual.</p>

<p>“Target, the head of the enemy small group--fire!”</p>

<p>The company's twelve mage soldiers threw away their concealment and unleashed their inner magic. Magic of the four attributes lays waste to the line of soldiers. If this were a volley of fire magic, it would be easy, but it is not.</p>

<p>“Ah, ah, ah, ah--?”</p>

<p>“My arm, my arm ah!”</p>

<p>“It's a magic soldier, if you freeze up, they'll eat you.”</p>

<p>"Don't leave on your own!</p>

<p>Through the fading dust, the results of the battle could be seen. Some sat stunned by the impact, while others wielded their lost arms and spears. The men under his command waited like hounds for their prey, waiting for orders to follow. Friug releases them from their collars.</p>

<p>"All hands, charge!　Root cut. Cut them to the root!</p>

<p>The order pushed the strong men to the ground. Friug, who was ahead of the others, slammed his spear down on them with the same force he had used in the run-up. The hilt flexed, and the windswept tip of the spear broke through the militiaman's imperfect defense. The tip of the blade made contact with the helm, and with a deafening high-pitched sound, it ran down the side of the head, splitting the soft neck.</p>

<p>Fresh blood spurts out like a fountain. In the blood mist, Friug has his sights set on his next target. A regular Craist officer to unite the militia. He is eager to quell the chaos with a shout. Every time the soldiers accompanying Friug swung their spears in time with his footsteps, a path opened up. Friug himself pierced the militiamen in his path twice.</p>

<p>The obstacle was gone, and the commander of Craist's army was exposed before his eyes. The sharp thrusts were once repelled by the belly of the sword, but repeated thrusts caused wounds and blood seeped through the gaps in his armor.</p>

<p>"Someone, help me!</p>

<p>The commander asked for help, but the difference in skill level between him and the others was obvious. No matter how many demons they had killed, they were not facing a unit that had been equipped with the intent to kill. A spear extended from the side easily pierced his knee. It was a blow from a subordinate who had an empty hand. This was no contest of swordsmanship. Friug had no intention of getting involved in a one-on-one fight. Rather, one against many is the situation a soldier should face.</p>

<p>"Stop!</p>

<p>The future is bleak for those who crawl on the battlefield. It was not a hand that was offered, but a stone poke and the sole of a shoe.</p>

<p>“The captain has been killed!”</p>

<p>“Are we retreating, what are we going to do?”</p>

<p>The upset over the loss of the commander was delirious. Only the convenient words are cut out and infect the group. The fragility of a group that has not established a chain of command.</p>

<p>"Retreat?　Is that an order to retreat!"</p>

<p>“Retreat!”</p>

<p>“Retreat, retreat!”</p>

<p>Even though there is an intact light infantry company in front of them, the militiamen, trapped in the hallucination of the battlefield, show their backs and move in defeat.</p>

<p>"It's collapsed. Drive them back and strike them down!"</p>

<p>The officers repeat the company commander's words. This was to convey the group's intentions to the soldiers, even in battle. It is not impossible for a group of soldiers to fight through a battle in silence, but no commander would go out of his way to bind his voice in the midst of battle.</p>

<p>“...... is foolish.”</p>

<p>If they slashed at each other head-on, they would not have been killed unilaterally. The militiamen would have been speared in the back as they fled, and the militiamen would have been knocked off their feet and fallen. Retreat is the most difficult action in battle. There was no way they could escape without leaving behind even a lord. The pursuit, which could hardly be called a pursuit, was carried out until the last man was killed.</p>

<p>“Did they die with something in their arms?”</p>

<p>The reason for their slow escape was the loot they wore. In the face of death, they discarded their weapons, but not their loot. In a war in which the supply by the Transportation Corps was not perfect, looting was also tolerated by the military as a form of local procurement. This was because there was a limit to the amount of food and fodder that could be carried by individuals. In addition, in some battles, looting was tacitly approved or tolerated in order to improve the morale of the soldiers. The Highserk Imperial Army has also done this.</p>

<p>"I guess the dissatisfaction of the Felician militia was stronger than we imagined. A run on the field, an example, and a venting of gas is a reasonable place to start."</p>

<p>Cleanliness alone is not enough to turn an army around. But there are limits to what can be done. If the occupied areas, which are also production bases, are destroyed, it will take a lot of time and effort to rebuild. Highserk has imposed restrictions and limitations on overcrowding in important areas by military decree. From a humanitarian standpoint, Highserk, as a small country, could even be said to value its human resources. People would kill and be killed, but they would not die in vain.</p>

<p>"Numbers swell, but officers and enlisted men don't grow up fast. I don't know that Craist would have indigestion with the people he held on to, either."</p>

<p>This is probably the downside of not absorbing the land and people in stages. It saturated the management. Friug goes around poking corpses with his backhanded spear. If they are allowed to get away with their deaths, their hand will be exposed. If that happened, they would have died in vain, even if they had cut out the roots.</p>

<p>"Captain!　There are reports of casualties."</p>

<p>The one who called out was the most senior officer among the platoon leaders attached to the company commander.</p>

<p>“...... how did it go?”</p>

<p>"There were twenty-three killed in action and thirty-five seriously wounded, but with the treatment of the frontline healing magician, many of them can return to the front line. There were two who couldn't be helped, and we eased them out."</p>

<p>"I see, I understand. Thank you for your concern on my behalf."</p>

<p>The platoon leader, who had summarized the damage from the various units, reported back to Friug. The bodies of the Craist militia were scattered all over the place. The kill ratio was no less than ten to one. Considering the fact that they were more than the same size, it was a good performance.</p>

<p>"Let the wounded go down first, along with the platoon with the most damage. We have a long way to go. We cannot afford to be exhausted."</p>

<p>The orders from Brig. Gen. Justus were not for defense or recapture. It was to collect the troops and buy time until the forces scattered around the country could be assembled.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. By the way, do you want to clean up the bodies?"</p>

<p>"Leave them as they are. Even though they were preoccupied with the scramble, the impact of slaughtering a company's worth of soldiers was not small. They will be aware of counterattacks and ambushes, even if they don't want to be."</p>

<p>The battle seemed to be won, but in the grand scheme of things, they were outnumbered. The war situation cannot be reversed by the efforts of individual units. And although they are now the affordable old Ferius militia, they are the ones who were able to hang on to the meat grinder that is the Demon Domain and survive. People are flexible and grow. They will learn lessons from their comrades-in-arms, even if they don't like it.</p>

<p>Friug looked up to switch his thoughts. His widening field of vision showed corpses and soldiers, but there was something different about the people in the crowd. It was the family of the farmer who had been attacked when Friug was running for the order.</p>

<p>"Did the grandfather die, but the father survived? ...... If he had been the chief guardian, would all those family members have died, or would the soldiers have suffered fewer casualties?　No. That's a silly question, even for me."</p>

<p>Friug dismisses the meaningless question and prepares for the next. He has no trouble finding someone to swing his spear at.</p>

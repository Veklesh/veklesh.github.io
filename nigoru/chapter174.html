<p>Episode 21</p>

<p>Unable to bear the freezing cold, the man wipes his face. Mud stains stick to his face and muddy drops overflow from the palm of his hand. Looking up at the sky, he saw a torrential downpour that looked like an overturned handbasket. I ran up a simple staircase made of stakes and planks. The rainwater flowed away like a creek under my feet.</p>

<p>"When is it going to stop? This rain."</p>

<p>The rain had already been falling for three days, with varying degrees of intensity. If this were a farming village, there would be no need to worry about water shortages. In fact, they might welcome it. But in the Lehun region, where mining is the main industry, this rain is an abomination for the man who heads the group responsible for digging. Even if it is only one of the smallest tunnels.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've got an extra hand tub and rope. What the hell is going on inside?"</p>

<p>I raised my voice, deadened by the dust, to keep up with the pounding rain. A shadow in the dimness rose up with a muffled cry.</p>

<p>"Master Jidre, the water's getting up to your knees. In some places it's above my knees."</p>

<p>It was a young miner among the diggers who answered as he turned the water wheel for drainage in a single-minded effort. He was a subordinate of Zidre, the head of the diggers, and his face was more familiar and familiar than that of his grandson. His whole body was stained with sludge like a boar's mud makeup, and the level of water in the tunnels could be seen from the dirt on his lower half of his body.</p>

<p>"I can tell by looking at you!　What's going on with the drainage magician's arrangements?"</p>

<p>The unprecedented downpour required a sorcerer who could distort human reason. Those who create water with their magical power are also good at manipulating it. There was no one better qualified to scour the water out of the narrow, intricate tunnels.</p>

<p>"Well, the head of the miscellaneous department persisted, but it didn't work out because the people from the main tunnels No. 1 to No. 5 had mobilized all of them. They didn't have enough for us. The only one who came was an old man who used to work here."</p>

<p>Zidre's fears were confirmed. Even within a community called a mine, there were different employers and different jobs depending on the mine to which one belonged. There was a kind of territory. In normal times, when there was plenty of room to spare, but in this torrential downpour, it was not unreasonable to expect that both equipment and people would be fighting over each other. If the tunnels were destroyed, there would be no food for the workers. Few people would care about other mines.</p>

<p>"You've been retired for a long time, but you're welcome to come. Even a dying old man is better than no one."</p>

<p>Zidre is strong, hiding his inner frustration. Even though he was an old man with one leg in a coffin, he still had the ability to drain water using water-based magic. His body, like that of a dead tree, is also suitable for a small tunnel. If the mine were to collapse, he would be able to pay for the funeral.</p>

<p>"At this rate, it won't be enough to send even the old man out.</p>

<p>Then bring a cat next time.</p>

<p>“Well, why don't you make him learn how to scratch cats?”</p>

<p>The way the young, joking youngsters talk. It's truly pathetic that they can't tell if they're being serious or joking. The chief of the digging department began pumping water with a hand tub tied with a rope in his hand.</p>

<p>The miners, transporters, mountain-dwellers, or whatever they were, had no choice but to work hard on this day but to imitate the water-changers. The men in their day jobs were covered in sewage at the spots in the mine where there were heavy springs. They had just scraped out a few hundred gallons of water, while devoting their attention to the arrangements to be made in the future. The sound of steel being struck wildly echoed from within the tunnels. The rhythm, too crude to be called an early bell, is a signal.</p>

<p>“Give way, you're coming out.”</p>

<p>The miners, who had been engaged in drainage work at the back of the mine, erupted like ants. All of them were uniformly exhausted. Zidre pulled on their arms and waists as they trudged unsteadily to the surface. Those who crawled out had one destination in mind: the blacksmith's hut.</p>

<p>The place where they usually rebuild and forge digging tools, such as trowels and pickaxes, has been turned into a fireplace to keep warm in this weather. Furthermore, the men were too lazy to return to the mining town where they lived, and they were snoring like insects in the wintertime. Normally, this would have been a scene at the resting place set up in the mine, but no one would be so reckless as to fall asleep in a nearly submerged mine shaft.</p>

<p>In place of those with wounds that could be mistaken for ghouls, the replacements who had been resting in the blacksmith's hut jumped into the hole. After a bit of a scrubbing and a nap, they were fit enough to be called human.</p>

<p>“Careful, keep your head down, I wouldn't want you to break a limb.”</p>

<p>Zidre's shoulders shook as he blasted the youngsters into the tunnels. His call was drowned out by the sound of rain pounding on the ragged roof.</p>

<p>“Dig chief, come on, let's get you a meal!”</p>

<p>Sheltered from the raindrops by his hands, he was offered a bowl of lukewarm scrambled bean soup and bread. It must have been made in the forge used in place of the fire pit.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I'll take it, thank you."</p>

<p>I cleaned some of the dirt off with rainwater, sipped the soup, and shoveled the bread into my mouth. The crunchy, gritty texture is irresistible. My body is cold. I can feel the soup, even if it is lukewarm, moving from my esophagus to my stomach. After 20 seconds and a light meal, Zidre pulls out the rope and resumes his work.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the rain has begun to slow down. If the lull continues, it will mark the end of the water fun. Just as they were about to pull up the bucket from the puddle, a dull thud echoed through the water. A chill ran down my spine as my skin felt the slickness of a tongue licking over it.</p>

<p>“You gotta be kidding me.”</p>

<p>Zidre swears, and belatedly the youngsters notice it too.</p>

<p>“What's that noise?”</p>

<p>It's not just the sound. Zidre knew the shaking that traveled through the soles of his shoes and shook his guts - his worst memory.</p>

<p>“The tunnel's collapsed!”</p>

<p>"The tunnel collapsed!</p>

<p>Yes, that's impossible.</p>

<p>He scolded his men as they hurriedly peered into the tunnel below.</p>

<p>“Don't make a fuss, it's not ours. ...... Damn it, look at that.”</p>

<p>The distant slope pulsated like a living creature. A chain of underground spaces had collapsed and caved in. The earth washed away like water itself. Even Zidre, who had worked in the Refn mine for a long time, had never seen anything like it.</p>

<p>"The third main tunnel!　What's going on with the drainage tunnels?"</p>

<p>“Oh my God, part of it is avalanching into the mining town.”</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?</p>

<p>What do we do?</p>

<p>"Keep working, but if the chiefs in there start screaming like crazy, throw away your tools and get out of here. Don't get buried alive."</p>

<p>After quieting down the agitated workers, Zidre continued.</p>

<p>"You guys there, follow me. We're going to help the guys in the main tunnel.</p>

<p>“But, but, but, master Zidre, from the looks of him, he's not going to .......”</p>

<p>The young miner has a point. The slopes along the tunnels had caved in, and the muddy water had literally turned into a river. It's like a black border that refuses to accept people.</p>

<p>"Shut up, you guys, shut up and keep working. We don't want a repeat."</p>

<p>With that, Zidre wrapped the rope around his body, carried it on his back, picked up his digging tools, and climbed up the slope. The closer he gets to the site of the collapse, the more damage he sees. Twisted and broken arms extend out of the ground, and people line the ground, panting, as they fall to the sand and sand. They are the lucky ones. They are still breathing, and even the ones who have died are still in pristine condition.</p>

<p>"Stay as far away from the flowing water as possible. If you must go, drive a stake into the ground and put a lifeline on it.</p>

<p>With a shout, the miners scatter. Zidre follows the faint moaning voices to find the wounded and grabs them by the collar or side and drags them away. Sometimes he strikes them on the back, sometimes he pushes his fingers into their oral cavities and scrapes out the sediment they have swallowed. They also pounded and pushed on the hearts of those who were not breathing.</p>

<p>“The third main tunnel, the ground would have been solid and well equipped!”</p>

<p>Breathing unevenly from exhaustion, Zidre breathed on his shoulders and revealed his true feelings. Backed by an enviable amount of money and manpower, the main tunnel is equipped with large-scale lateral drainage channels, water pumping machines, and even drainage magicians. Small-scale cave-ins and accidents are possible. However, what happened before our eyes was the complete collapse of the tunnel. Fifty people were working in the small tunnel where Zidre was working.</p>

<p>“How many people are buried ......?”</p>

<p>As a miner, I didn't even want to think about it.</p>

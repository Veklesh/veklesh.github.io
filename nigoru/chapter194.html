<p>Episode 40 The Battle of Orsellica Slope</p>

<p>A dense, uneven terrain spread out at both ends of the descent, and from the bottom of the hill at the end of the slope, the rustle of people playing was approaching. The soldiers gathered at the cut-through waited, their growing unease dimmed by resignation.</p>

<p>“It's getting noisy somehow.”</p>

<p>When Walm complained about the unwanted visitors, the couple, the core of the company, agreed.</p>

<p>"At last, they're here. They're not very good at killing off signs, are they?"</p>

<p>“I guess they don't care to hide it.”</p>

<p>The imperial knights make a final confirmation before the clash that is finally about to begin.</p>

<p>“Are you sure you want to spare them the projection of the fire attribute magic?”</p>

<p>“Unlike demons, they're not so stupid as to go on a full attack from the very beginning.”</p>

<p>“A powerful reconnaissance to search for weak spots, huh?”</p>

<p>If it is a pack of demons, you can hunt them down until you run out of followers. However, the opponent is a human being with wisdom. Half-hearted attacks invite countermeasures. At the right time and place, firepower will have its maximum effect. They will come from the other side. Walm just has to wait for that moment.</p>

<p>"If you're serious from the start, don't hesitate to blow them up. You don't have to wait for our signal."</p>

<p>"Yeah, okay. I'll be in position. We'll both do our best."</p>

<p>The Demon Mask hanging from his waist trembled as he said, "This is a travesty, contrary to the owner who agreed to this. There was no need to expose his hand early. Walm, joined by the left-wing soldiers at his post, stares down below. The drums that signaled the attack echoed up the hill of Orzerica. A nostalgic, yet repulsive tension runs up and down my spine. He suppresses his racing heart with a tight breath. Soon, black grainy figures appear one after another from around the bend, and in the blink of an eye, they become an army.</p>

<p>"Just push off the enemy soldiers who are climbing the mound. Don't be greedy!"</p>

<p>Moyes, who doubles as the leader's assistant and platoon leader, raises his voice and instructs his troops. Whether it is because he is dealing with a human being or in a position to organize his subordinates, his voice is still firm. The Royal Craist Militia, the spearhead of the group, slowly advances up the hill with bamboo bundles and miscellaneous shields in front of them. The gloomy soil, shaded by trees and blocking the sunlight, could cause them to fall over if they approached too quickly. Those who have survived the race for survival in the demon territory understand this. They are definitely the kind that have been baptized on the battlefield.</p>

<p>“No disorder?”</p>

<p>The pace of their steps and their unruffled line of battle told the story. It would have been somewhat easier if the regular soldiers of the Craist Royal Army, who served as commanders and officers, were leading with yells, but that was not likely to be the case. The impatient recruits were waiting for orders and apologizing. The imperial knights kept their eyes on a rock that sat halfway up the hill. The first group passed, halfway up the slope. A thunderous order rang out.</p>

<p>"Release!</p>

<p>The strings that had been taut burst at the same time as the instructor's call. Many of them were blocked by the shields of the soldiers, but a few slipped through and reported the results with a shriek. The thrower, who was spinning his sling behind the bowman, sent pebbles flying with the sound of the wind. The pebbles, which had transformed the power of heights into impact and destructive force, made a dull rupture sound and bit into the formation. Some of the barriers were damaged, and those who were out of luck stumbled to their deaths.</p>

<p>“Each of you, let loose freely, and watch out for contact with both sides!”</p>

<p>At Yogim's command, arrows and stones are fired at the hill one after another. The sight was spectacular, and some of the battle results could be seen with the naked eye. However, the speed of the battle line did not slow down. The soldiers joined the front line, which had a gap, and aimed at the earthen mound that blocked the cut-through. Following the pre-determined effective range of fire, the mage soldiers began to project their firepower. The line crumbles as if held by the hands of invisible giants, and a cheer escapes from the earthwork. However, the impact is not as great as it appears. The crumbling hole will soon be plugged.</p>

<p>“Don't rejoice, Rei is coming!”</p>

<p>His experience as a light infantryman and magician sounds the alarm. Immediately after Walm's evocation, the center of the enemy's line glowed faintly. It was an omen and warning that the mage soldiers were about to project magic, and with the impact, flames and dust danced in the air. The earth piled up in place of a breast wall collapsed.</p>

<p>"Aaagghhhh!　Arrrghhhh!"</p>

<p>A soldier with his face burned off thrashes about with a scream.</p>

<p>“Calm down, don't get violent, you won't die!”</p>

<p>Walm, who had fallen to his knees, held the wounded soldier down with his knees as if he were an unhearing child, and checked his wounds. Half of his face, centered on his cheek, was burned, but his sensory organs were still intact. The wound was somewhat ugly, but not fatal.</p>

<p>“Evrak, take him to the dirt platform at the back.”</p>

<p>At the far end of the cut and level area, in the earthwork circle that houses the men and supplies, the healer-magician is waiting. He ordered Evraak, who was waiting in the second row of horse treads, to transport them, but did not receive the desired response. Sparing no time, Walm reaches out his hand.</p>

<p>“Eh, ah.”</p>

<p>Walm ordered, rubbing his helmet as he grabbed the chest of the frozen soldier.</p>

<p>"Don't be stunned. It will soon become a common sight. Get used to it, okay?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!</p>

<p>Take him away. Tell the healer that her eyelids are burned off, but her eyes are fine.</p>

<p>If Ayane had been here, she would have been able to return to the front immediately, but the attack on the whole of the six mouths of Celebes dispersed the defenders' troops, and at the same time, drove the field healing station to the middle of the six mouths. If the wounded were not too severe, the healing sorcerers stationed at Orserica Hill would take charge. They are not the best. There will be scars, but they will let the soldiers join the line of fire the next day.</p>

<p>He grabs a wounded soldier by the shoulder and watches Evrakh descend the inner law of the earthen mound, and then turns his attention back to the front again. In addition to the mage soldiers, the enemy archers are also moving to return fire. This is probably to prevent unnecessary arrows based on the difference in elevation. Although the terrain gave them an advantage in the earthworks, the optimistic atmosphere that had prevailed until a moment ago had been blown away. Those who were hit directly by earth bullets were blown from their horse treads to the plains. Others half clutched at arrows lodged in their shoulders, trying to pull them out. Half in disgust, Walm said.</p>

<p>"Go and pull the arrowhead out with the fire shears. There will be a lot of blood, so stick a cloth in the wound."</p>

<p>“Ah, ah, yes, yes.”</p>

<p>“You're lucky it didn't go into your gut.”</p>

<p>“Ha...... hahaha, yes, I am.”</p>

<p>The imperial knight praises his good fortune with a smile, but the new recruit's face remains more drawn. He waddles down to the flat in search of the fire shears. An arrowhead with a return cannot be pulled out alone. Once it is stuck in the belly, it drags out the guts - the guts. Hence, belly manipulation. In the northern countries, where war is the norm, the art of war is not only the Highserk empire's. "You're not a medic.</p>

<p>“You're not a medic, what are you doing, huh?”</p>

<p>Highserk soldiers, who are constantly wounded and alive, are quite adept at first aid, so it was no trouble at all. The imperial knight dismissed such an imitation of a healing magician as part of his on-the-job training. Without magic or skills, this might have been a role like this. He drove the unrealistic IF out of his mind. Even though the soldiers had a bad start, they gradually became accustomed to an environment where magic and projectiles were flying around. The number of wounded was decreasing, and they worked to intercept the attackers.</p>

<p>"It's earth magic, aim there. Don't let them get a foothold!!!!"</p>

<p>Moyes astutely found the foothold for the offensive and ordered his archers. So far, so good for a rookie platoon leader. Walm patted the back of the perilous recruit to make up for the shortfall.</p>

<p>“Don't peek more than you have to, or you'll get a thrust right under you and a projectile from the front, you want your head smashed in!”</p>

<p>Walm calls out to the whole group as he walks behind the line of soldiers. With their shields raised, many of the enemy troops reached the edge of the earthworks. The soldiers dropped off small rocks the size of babies and served boiled gruel for the visitors. The miscellaneous plants and scraps of wheat have a starchy consistency that penetrates well into clothing and armor. All but those without magical membranes and those with the fire attribute let out a shout of joy.</p>

<p>"Make sure you kill the one who climbs out. Just keep repeating it."</p>

<p>No one responded to the imperial knight's reminder, but they heard the order as if they were clinging to it. The slope of the earth mound was made even more gentle by the enemy's earth magic, which was attached to the cut, and a foothold was created. In addition, several ladders had been set up.</p>

<p>“Here they come, here they come!”</p>

<p>“We are the first spears!”</p>

<p>Soldiers who had dived through the earthworks and spears boldly announced themselves. The first spear pair was accompanied by a reward. The first spear team was awarded with a prize, and they were determined not to let their prize be snatched away. Gaston, who was delayed in his reaction for a moment, hurriedly slammed his spear down, but the skilled militiaman easily repelled the spear with his shield.</p>

<p>“Ah, naaah!”</p>

<p>Just as the enemy soldier, who had waded through the obstruction, was about to slash at the dismayed Gaston, an axe spear that had cut through the gap between people pierced into his side.</p>

<p>“Aaagh, aaagh!”</p>

<p>Walm, who stirred inside the militiaman's body with a twist of his wrist, clamped the hilt under his arm and thrust back with his weight. The slope, which reaches forty-five degrees, effectively slides down the obstacle called a person. The following person, who became collateral damage, tumbles down the slope with a voice that is neither a scream nor an angry shout.</p>

<p>"Don't strike halfway. Poke it with your hip or hit it from the uppermost."</p>

<p>Without so much as a word of instruction to Gaston, Walm runs to fill in for the other recruits' missteps. It's frustrating not being able to rely on magic. Even so, he still can't cut his cards. The enemy is not so naive as to win a war with only one imperial knight.</p>

<p>"Take the place of the fallen, and don't let the enemy take advantage of you!</p>

<p>The new platoon leader shouted, and Evrakh, who had transferred the wounded to the rear, jumped in. He was about to slide his eyes to the others. Two enemy soldiers run up the slope, aiming at Moyes, who continues to call out.</p>

<p>"Moyes!</p>

<p>The tip of a sword extends from under the shield raised by the enemy soldiers. Moyes, on the other hand, made two small thrusts with the spear in his hand. The spear tip strikes the body through the armor, pushing away the two sharp-edged spearheads. The enemy soldiers disappeared from the earthworks, and two cries of abuse echoed from the foot of the earthworks like a duet. It was a needless worry, Walm snarled. Perhaps the couple's fears were misplaced, and overprotection was the only truth.</p>

<p>"The chief protector is safe, sir.</p>

<p>I'll know it when I see it."</p>

<p>Such an attack and defense continued for about half a minute, and then without warning, the retreating drums sounded. The Craist Kingdom army, which had been on the offensive, retreated like the ebb tide. All that was left were fresh corpses lying on the slope.</p>

<p>"Up there, don't stop the chase!　The lightly wounded have to wash their wounds and cover them with a cloth. Be prepared for the wounds to rot if you skip it. You guys, go down with Yogim and collect your arrows."</p>

<p>Walm, who had confirmed the survival of the head instructor, let out the breath he had been holding. He played it back safely. It was a good first day, and such relief lasted until he saw the dead bodies lying on the mound. There were many wounded, but few dead. Still, the number of corpses was more than one hand could hold. One of the recruits shook his friend who had not moved. His eyes simply stared into the void, and his mouth, which said nothing, eloquently conveyed what was happening.</p>

<p>“Hey, idiot, why are you dead!”</p>

<p>Is he accepting death as much as not calling out for a crying cure magician? Walm bit his lip as such a military spirit made him appreciate his adaptability. Even though the numbers were small, words, indeed words, had been exchanged, and they were dead. Is that the first thing that comes to mind? I felt that, one step further, my diminutive humanity was being diluted by the sludge that is the battlefield.</p>

<p>"...... Don't lean, don't lean. Don't polarize your mind. Keep yourself."</p>

<p>I told myself strongly, as if it were a joke. The imperial knight, shivering from the unknowable chill, took off his steaming survery and scratched his scalp.</p>

<p>If he had done everything in his power, could he have prevented the deaths? He almost thought of that, and then interrupted his train of thought. It was a meaningless escape. Don't get trapped. If you expose your cards early, more people will die as a result. What we need to do now is to care for the living. And burn the dead into our memories. We cannot allow our clouded eyes to distract us from reality. The war has only just begun.</p>

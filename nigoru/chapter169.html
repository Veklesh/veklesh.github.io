<p>Episode 16</p>

<p>The door closed from the outside pounded on the doorstep. Maia, Moritz, and the guards line up and take their seats outside the room, leaving only one girl left. The room is enveloped in silence. Even the sound of breathing is perceptible.</p>

<p>“I'm so glad you're alive.”</p>

<p>The words sounded as if they had been squeezed out. Walm promised Ayane that he would return home before going to the front after transplanting the eye that had been gouged out. They were reunited in this way, but it was a con of sorts, taking roughly two years to complete.</p>

<p>"...... sorry for the delay. I just realized that with Tyrant Worm's oral cavity, there wasn't a single person left in Dandurg. I honestly thought they had been wiped out, leaving me behind."</p>

<p>Walm goes on to scratch out the trajectory of his steps. He describes his escape through Dandurg, through the fallen imperial capital, and into the archipelagic countries, where he became addicted to escapism. He told of his escape from blindness to alcoholism, and finally, too late, he was on his way back to Japan. The girl heard everything that was said. Ayane paused to chew the words slowly. Then she opened her mouth.</p>

<p>"If you call it escape, I'm no different. After the Great Outbreak dawned, it was a terrible scene. What happened at Dandurg Castle, there was an even greater tragedy all over Myard."</p>

<p>The damage in both Ferius and Myard, which were directly connected to the Great Demon Domain, was lukewarm to even describe the extent of the damage. A great number of wreckage was exposed to the earth. Even the Great Outbreak that reached Highserk's home country was reduced in scale. It is easy to imagine the scene Ayane would have seen, even though she took a different path for a time.</p>

<p>"At first it was to avoid facing reality. If you are immersed in treatment, you don't have to think about anything else. In fact, there were so many injured people that there was no time to rest my hands."</p>

<p>Ayane's gaze follows the line of empty bunks. Had the people filling the bunks left the sanitarium after receiving treatment? Or--.</p>

<p>"They call me a rare healing magician and healer, but I am not such an exalted person. I just healed to daze the past in a safe place. I did not shed blood and cut myself to protect people like Mr. Walm and others. I can only be useful after people are hurt."</p>

<p>A traceable grimace. I couldn't look at her painfully. Walm waited until the girl regained her breathing, then slowly shook his head in denial.</p>

<p>"Don't be so down on yourself. No one is completely innocent. Besides, at that healing site, Ayane did not yield to the threat of the sword and tried to stay behind with firm conviction."</p>

<p>In accordance with his prior strategic plan, Walm, along with the rest of the army, had planned to leave the refugees behind. It was too much of a decision to be made by others and lacked autonomy. If it had not been for the voice of a girl in front of him, he would have carried out his decision, using the chain of command and the military organization as a bargaining chip.</p>

<p>"When the command center disappeared, I tried to abandon many people. It may be a cheap word, but Ayane changed me then. Otherwise, we might not be talking like this, and many of us would have died."</p>

<p>Walm looks at Ayane with clouded eyes. The girl looked up from her gaze and smiled awkwardly.</p>

<p>"I know we just met, but I'm sorry I had to encourage you. Thank you, thank you,...... but even Walm-san is too demeaning."</p>

<p>“Is that what Ayane says?”</p>

<p>Ayane's voice leaks out in response to Walm's bewilderment. For the first time since their reunion, the smile returned. The tension is released, and the tightened breath is let out. She relaxed her tense shoulders and leaned back in her chair.</p>

<p>“May I ask you something that has been bothering me?”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Despite his hard tone, there was no tension in his voice. Tilting his head to meet his gaze, Walm urged him to continue.</p>

<p>“So, Walm, your first life was in Japan?”</p>

<p>I see, I agreed. The topic of where we were both from was something Walm had been curious about. After all, it is not always the case that the worlds we lived in before we were swept away were exactly the same. Multiverse theory, parallel world theory, or whatever you want to call it, there are different worlds with different theories. We cannot wipe out the possibility of worlds that are just very similar.</p>

<p>“Is there anything you can write about?”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, please.”</p>

<p>Ayane walks quickly to her desk, finds a piece of paper and a pen, and hurriedly holds them out.</p>

<p>“What about Japan?”</p>

<p>“I know it well.”</p>

<p>Walm writes down characters as they develop a common understanding. It has been a long time since he has written kanji or a map of Japan. It is so distorted that it even looks like a toddler's scribble. Ayane feels nostalgia even for such scribbles. The response to her drawings of national characters, which she drew while cursing her lack of artistic talent, was not bad. The laughter surrounding the curious drawings must be insane from the other side.</p>

<p>It is an outrageous behavior for a poor Highserk, but he paints what looks familiar to him. It was a waste of paper and ink, for which mass production had not yet been established, but it did not stop him. Drawing a circle in the corner of a distorted map of Japan surrounded by awkward characters, Walm asked.</p>

<p>“I was born in Hachifuji City, did you know that?”</p>

<p>"Hachifuchi-shi?　I don't know, I'm from there too."</p>

<p>“Hey, you're lying!”</p>

<p>Walm, who couldn't believe his ears, replied immediately in surprise.</p>

<p>“Then do you know the old lady at the candy shop in front of the station?”</p>

<p>"It's near the Yafuchi station, right? She's been the same old lady since I was a kid."</p>

<p>Surprise turned to certainty. We were definitely from the same world. A faded, distant memory of my past as Yorizo Takakura is awakened. Bottles of carbonated beverages, bagged sweets, dokuraku and masks hung as if frozen in time. The old candy store, an old-fashioned wooden structure, was filled with things that attracted people regardless of the era, and even looked like a toy box.</p>

<p>“She's been an old lady since I was a kid.”</p>

<p>The sight of the old woman, unchanged for 30 years, made those who had returned to their hometowns feel at ease. Even if the redevelopment of the area in front of the station transformed the appearance of the town, the store and the old woman would never change. In retrospect, this may have been a marketing strategy in a sense. After all, it was not once or twice that I saw grown adults return to their childhood memories and spend their money at that store. He must have been a great manager.</p>

<p>“Haha, maybe he's some kind of monster.”</p>

<p>“It was one of the seven wonders of my alma mater.”</p>

<p>Covering her mouth with her hand, Ayane laughs mischievously.</p>

<p>"There was also such a thing. I didn't think they even went to the same school."</p>

<p>“They say the world is small, but it's true.”</p>

<p>Paper airplanes disappearing among the clouds, stairs at dusk that you can't descend, dark corridors where you can't see the end of the hallway, and, if you want to talk about cute things, a black cat that appears and disappears. There are many more, just off the top of my head. I said “seven wonders,” but in fact there may have been ten or twenty.</p>

<p>There was no end to the conversation with my literal hometown partner, let alone the world. For a while, I even forgot my original purpose. Ironically, it was Demon Mask that played the role of timekeeper. On the one hand, I wish I had left it with Moritz, but on the other hand, I can picture the soldier who was frightened by the cursed mask, which was shaking with anger and scattering. It was a very tactless mask, but it was also true that time was limited. Although it was not an emergency, there was still another patient to see.</p>

<p>Placing himself on the bed, Walm closed his eyelids. Even though his vision was closed, he could feel the magic swirling in the palms of his hands, which were probably held out to him. A warm light shines in the darkness.</p>

<p>“Please relax and be at ease.”</p>

<p>“Oh.”</p>

<p>Just as Walm has experienced many things in the past year and a half, the girl has also grown as a person. The eye treatment begins. The warm light makes Walm feel faint. Only then does the gruesome reality of her homeland fade away.</p>

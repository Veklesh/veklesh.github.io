<p>Episode 60</p>

<p>The inn towns that supported the trade routes of Cape Laga have now become a map entity. Not a single house remains standing along the road. All that remains is an uneven pile of ridge-like rubble and countless corpses. Many of the corpses were so damaged by the repeated attacks that they were far from what they had looked like when they were alive. Still, it was enough for Walm. The abominable evil eye sees only what it does not want to see.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Great Outbreak, the coming of the Flaming Dragon, and the loss of the command center. In order to live in such a cul-de-sac of despair, Walm exerted himself to the death with them in the old castle without any interest or calculation for that sole purpose. How could he forget his men, who had no rest, who had risked their lives to maintain a distorted line of battle, and with whom he had shared meager meals? No matter how much they may have changed, there is no mistaking them. Walm ordered the remaining soldiers in a flat voice so that they would not realize the passion in his heart.</p>

<p>“All hands, evacuate!”</p>

<p>The blood flowed like a muddy stream, and instead of cooling down, the heat only lingered in the pit of the stomach. The oppression was reaching a critical point. Friug's company was reduced to the size of a squadron, not a platoon. The ability to challenge the battlefield in perfect condition was a poor dream. It was nothing more than a fairy tale. And yet. They were forced to be used up and crushed in a place like this, as if they were fighting together against the Great Outbreak and wishing to rebuild their homeland. They must have looked terrible. Walm was grateful for this one time to the demon that covered his face.</p>

<p>“Don't make me use it, kill it!”</p>

<p>The milky killing intent, the countless blades that were coming at him, were about to be poured all over him. There is no need to make excuses, no need to be worried. Just reveal yourself. Walm transformed the heat in his body and the unvoiced lamentation into a blue flame, and spewed out Demon Fire with all his emotion. The hot wind swirled around her body as if caressing it, and her Demon Mask laughed with a ticklish smile.</p>

<p>The countless outstretched arms were extinguished by the azure flames, and one after another, the human-shaped lights were lit up with a decisive sound. The well-controlled formation is no longer visible, and they are entangled with each other like strings. One Craist soldier, writhing in agony in the arms of the blue flames, intervened in the path of the others. Was he trying to grab it, or was he reaching out for help? Walm cut him down without a glance. Then, walking with a broad step, he repeats it as if he is clearing away weeds. Over and over. Over and over.</p>

<p>“Hah, hah, fuh ...... ugh.”</p>

<p>The eyesore wall burned away. Countless objects that used to be people rolled around at my feet. Without any sense of accomplishment, the sticky, tar-like, stagnant hatred remained smoldering. Breathing unevenly, as if drowning, I found myself breathing on my shoulders. It is not just fatigue. The wear and tear on his spirit had taken its toll on his body. The emotion-driven “Demon Fire” had indeed struck the enemy with a painful blow, but that was all. But that was all. Only those who have become accustomed to burning people would be able to detect the extremely pungent odor that sinks into the nostrils. As a result of unnecessarily increasing the firepower, the skin and muscles of the person were burned away, and even the organs held in the belly were scorched. The corpse, the surface of which had begun to carbonize, was being driven away by the hot air and crumbled to pieces.</p>

<p>"Huh, haha ...... that's ironic. I can't believe the smell of death is making you cool."</p>

<p>Reason, which had been coated in rage, rapidly turns to thought. Burning a mere hundred people will not change the war situation. Will he wield violence at random, like an infant's tantrum? Military reason sounded a painful warning that this was not the case. They should have burned those closest to them and left the rest to burn alive. Walm had learned from experience that wounded men were a logistical burden. Besides, the main target should not be the enemy's sharpshooters. The real target was the rallying points and crossing points.</p>

<p>He saw the corpse of Friug, the commander who had led the company. His former subordinates, now in flames, speak of nothing. The searing rage and hatred still remain. It is human to be distraught and shed tears. Walm, however, has accepted the current situation dispassionately. Experience diminishes emotion. Whether it is joy or sorrow. Has he grown accustomed to even foolishly losing? In the distance, the sword that never reached his comrade-in-arms shook in the hot wind.</p>

<p>“At least, I'll take over after you.”</p>

<p>As a result of the continuous fighting and maneuvering, there is already not enough magic and physical strength left to strike in a wide area. Wasting magical power was a mistake, but it was not all bad. A sanctuary by “Demon Fire” has been formed on the battlefield centered on the inn town. We don't have to worry about the spears of a single soldier. We just focus on high-value targets and act accordingly.</p>

<p>“There, huh?”</p>

<p>The sword indicates where the Lord was aiming. Walm follows without hesitation. He thrusts out his axe spear and stares at the target through his face. The innocence of those days is fading, and he is in the process of developing from a boy to a young man. His hometown, clutching his sword tightly, is surrounded by the knights who accompany him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Fusei!　The small army is no match for them. The magician is getting burned!"</p>

<p>“Youto-sama, please stay back here.”</p>

<p>You want us to abandon our allies and run away?</p>

<p>There are no friends left to save. They have all burned up.</p>

<p>The escorting knights remained calm even as the blue flames seared their magical membranes. Unlike infantry, which can be replaced, mage soldiers are valuable. If their firepower is of a tactical level, it is only logical to try to conserve it. But even Walm had no intention of letting a high-value target go.</p>

<p>"What? Are you just going to leave him there and run away again?</p>

<p>There was no time to choose between the innocent and the filthy. Walm said in a light tone. These were not the words he would use to address his countrymen. They were curses and curses that only those who had been in the Sarajevo treatment center would understand.</p>

<p>“You bastard!!!!!!!”</p>

<p>The young man's impassioned voice echoed. It was a cheap, transparent provocation. It would not stop for a moment. Still, it was enough for Walm. The body, which had been accelerated rapidly with ridges of blue flame, skidded on the ground without warning. The acceleration caused by the hot air produced a speed that defied the structure of the human body. First, he scraped off the piece located at the left end, the flying wheel.</p>

<p>"Renato, it's coming!</p>

<p>"What the hell?</p>

<p>The two guards lifted their swords while being caught off guard. The knight called Renate deflected a thrust aimed at his throat with the belly of his sword. In fact, he even showed off a little trick where he used the recoil from the clash of the tips of his swords to wrap his sword around the target and strike back. The elite knights of Reharzen are indeed the best of the best. However, the act of shallowly striking an imperial knight, even with an axe spear, was rash and hasty. Walm twisted his wrist slightly. The quarter-turned hilt thrusts the downward-facing branch blade to the side. The metal scratches and vibrates, followed by a bump.</p>

<p>“BUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”</p>

<p>A strange sound echoes from the clogged drain pipe, as if water is gushing out with great force. It was fresh blood overflowing from Renato's neck. The branch blade scraped the surface of his breastplate, scratching the carotid artery and nerves. Before he had time to redeploy the magical membrane, his consciousness blacked out completely.</p>

<p>Walm's gaze slips from the virtually dead to the remaining enemy. He had intended to go for the second man without a pause, but the remaining Reharzen knights and Yout acted quickly.</p>

<p>“OH NO!!!!”</p>

<p>Instead of following their backs, two swords are swung down on their paths from both sides. At this rate, they would be entangled. But even so, half-hearted evasions will be too distracting. Without slowing down, the imperial knight lowered his center of gravity and pulled back the hilt of his axe and spear. The branch blade bites into Renate's crumpled shoulderplate and pulls the dying knight to his feet.</p>

<p>Yout's slash is deflected by the unexpected collision of his compatriots. The remaining knight's blow looms. Walm slides through the ground, letting inertia and gravity take over. The tip of the sword snatches his neck, and the Demon Mask is agitated as if it were riding on an attraction. The reason why he did not defend himself with his bystander's mask was not because he was in a good mood, but simply because he did not want to be shocked.</p>

<p>“Fusei, behind you!”</p>

<p>Walm dived between the two men, but at Yout's advice, the remaining Reharzen knight, Efsei, reversed, and with a cry, he readied his sword at the top. The enemy had no time to spare, and neither did he. They have no intention of letting the imperial knight get up again.</p>

<p>“Ha, ah, ah!”</p>

<p>He folded his outstretched legs, dug the soles of his shoes into the earth, and struck the ground with the tip of his hilt, the stone thrust. The momentum, which is not enough, is conveniently boosted by the hot air, and Walm jumps up with a start. Efsei's face contorts in surprise. The tip of the ear is slashed up in time with the slash down. A dull metallic sound echoes. After a moment of antagonism, the axe head, charged with magic power, bounces off the sword, and the axe spear bites into the waistband that protects the lower abdomen.</p>

<p>“Ugggghhhhhhhh!”</p>

<p>Blood spurts from the cracks in the armor. The blow reached the internal organs, but did not sever the spine. As soon as he tried to pull it out, something unusual happened. It did not move forward or backward. Efsei was holding the axe spear lovingly with a wry smile. The sword pierced the remaining shadow of Walm, who let go of the hilt without a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>“You can't take this with you to the underworld!”</p>

<p>He spat the biggest compliment to his enemy, who held and sealed one of his main weapons. The imperial knight took a step or two in time and picked up the longsword at his waist. Then he was once again face to face with one of Craist's three heroes.</p>

<p>"All that's left is you. There is no one else who can hold you like you did then. Do you want to surrender?"</p>

<p>Yuto possessed powerful magic, but as a mage soldier, his slow feet were a disadvantage. If this had been Mako, who manipulated the four attributes, he would have been able to escape by taking advantage of his agility with wind- and water-attribute magic. The magic power was nearly exhausted, and the blue flame was flickering as if it was panting. We had to finish the job before the remaining fire was extinguished. The young man spits out his feelings to the imperial knight, who chooses frivolous words to shake him up.</p>

<p>"Don't lick me!　I'm not like that."</p>

<p>Contrary to the bluish oath, the magic power rapidly increases. How could he forget that characteristic foreboding? The scene at the mine flashes back. If he releases the “Holy Strike” at this close range, the user will not be safe. Another self-destruction. Why was a young man from his hometown rushing to his death? The Imperial Knight braced himself, but his prediction was betrayed. The light was not released, but rather rapidly converged. The light was not released, but rather rapidly converged.</p>

<p>“...... Oh yeah?”</p>

<p>Only the child and Demon Mask were pleased with the new shiny toy. Walm responded to the light sword approaching at the upper level with his flaming sword. The two light sources sparked and fought each other to devour the other.</p>

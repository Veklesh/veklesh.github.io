<p>Episode 45</p>

<p>Trees that have lost their branches and leaves stand like wrecks. The fresh greenery that once dotted the landscape has now burned away, and all that is left is gray. There is no sign of life on the slope that stretches across the cut. The vegetation has decayed, and even the demons have long since fled. Ironically, only the humans, who have turned into rational beasts, are piling up corpses on top of each other.</p>

<p>“Don't let up, pile up the dirt.”</p>

<p>“Where are the enemy mage soldiers!”</p>

<p>Multiple tailing roads, winding like lightning, were excavated chest-deep to repel the projectiles. The projectile points were piled with clods of earth packed in jute sacks for military provisions and fodder, and even half-hearted attack magic could withstand a direct hit.</p>

<p>“I didn't hear that the successor was more trouble than he was worth--I guess I shouldn't have killed him in the first place.”</p>

<p>Once the enemy position group was burned down by Demon Fire, the complex terrain prevented the fire from spreading. The characteristics of the Souka were also carefully known, so the damage could not be spread beyond the targeted small group. Such measures had been taken before. The Liberitoa Trade Federation had created countermeasures and made steady progress despite the damage they had sustained during the retreat from the Refn mine.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, they could not just sit back and let the pressure swell. It was urgent to vent, and Walm's target was the junction of the finishing detour. The enemy soldiers, sensing the attack magic, sent out a warning mixed with screams. Immediately afterward, the fireball that had landed on the ground burst, and the impact and heat consumed the earth.</p>

<p>“Instant death, or did they use a corpse as a shield?”</p>

<p>There are no demons in the dancing blue flames, only reddish-black sediment that dances slightly. Killing one or two would be good enough. Walm, who was checking the results of the battle among the soldiers, caught sight of an enemy soldier poking his head out of the ground and issued a warning.</p>

<p>"They're coming!</p>

<p>The attackers in Orsellica exited first, starting with those who could not pay attention to their surroundings. It was a short cry, but the reaction of the surroundings was swift. The water bombs that formed blew away the breastworks heaped up on the edges of the earthen mound. Cold earth and sand rained down from overhead. The soldiers, who quickly threw themselves down and fell down, shook their heads like dogs to get rid of the sludge and shouted angrily.</p>

<p>“Damn you, you're shooting at us a little bit like rats!”</p>

<p>"What's wrong with our 《Dirt Bullet》!　They're shooting at us like rats!</p>

<p>“I'm out of magic, I'm falling back.”</p>

<p>The soldiers, expecting a counterattack, turned their attention to the imperial knight.</p>

<p>"It's no use now. They will have moved on by now."</p>

<p>The soldiers bowed their heads in unfulfilled retaliation. The enemy was no fool. They do not like to lose their scarce magic soldiers, and after attacking, they run away like rabbits. It was a kind of one-hit-disengage strategy. Walm, however, is not in a position to condemn them. They roam the horse treads as well, and they are always ready to shoot.</p>

<p>“I'm putting all my weight on the wound and it won't stop bleeding.”</p>

<p>"Ice spear?　Shove a cloth into the shooting wound. Just holding it from above won't stop it."</p>

<p>"Get him out of here. The horse is not a sickbed.</p>

<p>The debris is gone!</p>

<p>"Bring the debris from the flat. It's too late when it's gone.</p>

<p>Walm's face contorts at the sight of the unidentifiable liquid clinging to the soles of his shoes. He disliked the maneuvering in the field, running around until his heart burst, but he didn't like the defensive fighting, where they rasped at each other and tried to bleed to death.</p>

<p>"Get the bodies down and switch. Don't open the gap."</p>

<p>“Shove a burlap sack into the collapsed chest wall, we don't have time to carefully fix it.”</p>

<p>"Return fire!　Somebody shut the shooter up!</p>

<p>I'm hit! I'm hit!</p>

<p>You idiot, you're peeking too much!</p>

<p>The archer, who had been jumping when the arrow hit him, was hit by an arrowhead in the shoulder and sprawled around. Obviously, the way of doing things has changed. I sense a unified will in the relative group. While retaining the color of their predecessor's policy, their offensive had become more aggressive. The stalemate had switched from one that avoided exhaustion to one that allowed damage and forced exhaustion. The day-and-night onslaught was based on a planned rotation. It was the result of an abundance of troops.</p>

<p>“Chief Protector, there is a change of troops.”</p>

<p>The only saving grace was that we too had reinforcements. Running half-heartedly along the top of the earthen mound were the soldiers dispatched from the branch castle to fill in the rear. One-third of Deborah's training company had already been disabled, and two new platoons had been dispatched from the branch castle. The stalling outposts are holding up better than expected. No wonder they are tempted to up the ante with reinforcements.</p>

<p>“Is it that late already?”</p>

<p>It was last night when I got into position. Then the moon set, the sun passed its peak, and the sun was setting. Then Walm finally became aware of the fatigue that was clinging to him.</p>

<p>"Yes, you have already been fighting for half a day.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll stay until we switch. I'll stay until we switch."</p>

<p>Down the inner law of the stepped passage, the replacement of the troops was carried out in a solemn manner. Walm, supported by Moyes, the commander, watches the last of his men leave the earthworks. He passes through a flat area crowded with first aid and supplies, and as he nears the bend, he notices a familiar figure.</p>

<p>"Hello, Mr. Walm. Are you on your way home from work?"</p>

<p>It was Yorgim who raised his hand. He must be heading back to the front lines after a short rest.</p>

<p>“The enemy was so persistent, they wouldn't let me go home,” he said.</p>

<p>“I'm fed up with working endless overtime.”</p>

<p>Their tired appearance and cheerful tone of voice are only reflected in their empty cheerfulness. Although they were in different places and in different worlds, their conversation sounded like that of office workers on their way home from work. Walm let out a breath of air with the tension that had been building.</p>

<p>“Huh, ha, ha.”</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm glad you like it. So how's it going on the front lines?"</p>

<p>"It's changed drastically. If it weren't for the arrival of the rear-guard troops, we'd probably be retreating to the main line by now."</p>

<p>"The enemy commanders who replaced us are outnumbering our men, for better or worse. I'm not going to give them time to think about anything else while I give them the rest they need."</p>

<p>“Live and let live,” huh?</p>

<p>"That's a very dangerous word. I wonder if that's what the Highserk people teach."</p>

<p>The imperial knight protested to Yogim, who declared with a straight face.</p>

<p>“What do you think we are?”</p>

<p>"Oops, I slipped up. I'd love to stay and chat over dinner, but I'm afraid to keep Deborah waiting."</p>

<p>"I value our time together as a couple. I'll enjoy my thin barley porridge alone."</p>

<p>Walm watches Yogim's back as he runs off, and then continues on his way through the bend. His destination was the cookhouse rising from the side of the barracks. The boiling cauldrons of steam irritate his empty stomach. It was one of the few pleasures one could enjoy on the battlefield, where there was no freedom as far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>"Hey, why don't you put in a little more?</p>

<p>The one who was complaining was a new recruit who had been fighting until a few minutes ago. The cooks brushed off such pleas.</p>

<p>"You keep making the bowls bigger, but we're not going to increase the quantity.</p>

<p>The cooks pushed a clay-like flatbread at him, and the new soldier left with a lament. The soldiers behind him wait anxiously, with evil expressions on their faces. It is a sad habit from a previous life to line up in rows. Without difficulty, it was the Imperial Knight's turn. A bowl of cloudy barley gruel is poured into the bowl. Walm, who had the infamous flatbread in his other hand, found it as he wandered around looking for a place to eat.</p>

<p>“I didn't know it was lying in a place like this.”</p>

<p>It was a wine barrel that until recently had been filled with wine. It was fresh in his memory that an unsuspecting soldier was peering into the empty bottom of the barrel after it had been consumed. In addition to its repurposing, it must have been brought into the bend to end the obsession.</p>

<p>Walm sat down at the barrel. The faint scent of wine in the barrels seemed to drown out the smell of death. With all his strength, he shredded the flatbread and dipped it into the bowl. Something small was mixed in with the porridge. I rolled it on my tongue and realized what it was.</p>

<p>"...... fish?　Huh, this is fish meal."</p>

<p>The powdered ingredient mixed in with the barley porridge was ground up fish. It's not funny, but it's a common occurrence, a knife fight over the distribution of food. The result of his attempt to be fair was this. He took the last bite with a piece of bread instead of a spoon, and threw the crumb into his mouth. Then he threw the crumb into his mouth and finished his meal.</p>

<p>Taking a sigh of relief, he looks around him. There were people in all sorts of costumes, some throwing out their limbs, others curling themselves up, but all of them had fallen asleep as if they had fainted after finishing their meal. The imperial knights who felt full were no exception. The desire to eat was followed by the desire to sleep. With his back against the barrel, Walm wrapped himself in his cloak and slowly drifted off to sleep. The familiar cries and exclamations of the night are substituted for ugly lullabies.</p>
